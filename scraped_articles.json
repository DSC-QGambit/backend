[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nmeribah knight\n\nYeah. Right. And so you were \u2014 how old were you?\n\nspeaker 1 Seven.\n\nmeribah knight\n\nOh, my god. When Brandon was just seven years old, police showed up at his door to arrest him. Brandon\u2019s offense? Tagging along with his older brothers who\u2019d wrestled in a vacant duplex and left some holes in the drywall. Now police were there to take Brandon and his brothers to the juvenile detention center, jail, basically.\n\nspeaker 1 My mom said that they weren\u2019t going to take me in. But they were like, well, he needs to learn his lesson.\n\nmeribah knight\n\nBrandon was held in detention overnight and then brought to the juvenile court for his hearing.\n\nspeaker 1 They had me in shackles, from our feet to our arms, going into court.\n\nmeribah knight\n\nBrandon should have gone home with his mom that day. But when he went before the judge, she sent him back to jail for a week. Brandon\u2019s arrest and detention happened in Rutherford County, Tennessee. And his case wasn\u2019t unique there. For over a decade, the county was arresting and jailing kids for even the most minor offenses.\n\nspeaker 2 I didn\u2019t want to go to school. speaker 3 I just ran away. speaker 4 I spray painted a penis on a wall.\n\nmeribah knight\n\nIt happened so often, to so many kids in Rutherford County, that getting sent to juvenile detention was almost a rite of passage. In many cases, what it also was was illegal. This is the story of how that system came to be, how it came to be normalized, accepted, lauded even. It\u2019s also the story of two insiders who actually did see the problem in Rutherford County.\n\nspeaker 5 We would sit out, and smoke a cigarette, and say, we\u2019re going to burn this place to the ground. [LAUGHS]\n\nmeribah knight\n\nThey just needed other people to see it, too. From Serial Productions and the New York Times, I\u2019m Meribah Knight.

Don\u2019t be scared! Contrary to popular belief, the crossword is not a competition over how much trivia one knows. Yes, random facts and knowledge will come in handy when you\u2019re filling out the crossword grid, but believe in yourself.\n\nWhen attacking the grid head-on, take a few tries to figure out your style of solving. Jackie likes to go around the grid and fill in what she knows. Then she\u2019ll continue to go back through and see if her memory has been prompted by any letters that were filled in or if an answer has \u201cjust come\u201d to her the second or third time around. Isaac likes to start with easier clue types, like fill-in-the-blanks or abbreviations.\n\nRachel Fabi, a Wordplay columnist, takes a different approach. \u201cI start every puzzle the same way: I start in the northwest and work my way through,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it\u2019ll be going back and forth between across and downs in the corner and then building off of what you have, until you have the whole thing.\u201d\n\nHave you gotten as far as you can? Try using autocheck to make sure your answers are correct. Do you need to adjust anything? Go ahead. If you\u2019re still stuck, check out Wordplay, your new best friend. Wordplay is a daily column written by Games editors that explains tricky clues, answers and more about the New York Times Crossword. That one word Rachel, Deb Amlen or Caitlin Lovinger provides there may be the key you need to unlock the rest of your puzzle.

          "text": "The regular season is over. The postseason is over. The real season is here.\n\nPerhaps \u201coffseason\u201d was apt earlier in baseball history. Now, the offseason is as fun as any other time in the baseball calendar. Be honest: Do you actually play the games in The Show or OOTP? Or do you sim the season \u2014 with a break for late July, of course \u2014 just to get to the fun part of building a new roster?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is your landing page for the 2023-24 MLB offseason. It\u2019s our Free Agent Big Board, comprised of our top 40 rankings (a composite of individual rankings by Keith Law, Tim Britton, Aaron Gleeman, Eno Sarris and Jim Bowden), stats breakdowns, contract projections, best fits and more. And whenever any player signs, check back here for instant analysis \u2014 how the fit works for the player and the team \u2014 all offseason long.\n\nWhile this isn\u2019t the deepest free-agent class, it makes up for it with star power and intrigue. Shohei Ohtani should break records for overall guarantee and/or average annual value in his next contract. Yoshinobu Yamamoto might be the best pitcher to ever move from Nippon Professional Baseball in Japan to the major leagues. Aaron Nola has been one of the sport\u2019s best and most durable starters for a half-decade and Cody Bellinger is one of its streakiest talents.\n\nAnd the number of teams looking to make an offseason statement is higher than ever. Teams accustomed to spending big (and often winning big) had down seasons in 2023 in New York (both the Bronx and Queens), Boston, St. Louis and San Francisco. The Dodgers saved up for this offseason with a quiet winter last year and are coming off another playoff disappointment.\n\nBecause here\u2019s the thing: Free agency really matters in baseball. The Rangers just spent October hammering home how successful, not to mention how fun, the return on major free-agent investment can be.\n\nSome bookkeeping: The player\u2019s listed age is how old he\u2019ll be on June 30 of next season (and thus what age he\u2019s considered for the full season), the stats are from the 2023 season, the WAR is from FanGraphs, the best fits are alphabetical and you can filter through by position or search by name.\n\nBookmark, star, Ctrl/Cmd+D depending on your preference, and check back in all winter. In the offseason, this page is always on.\n\nPosition 1B 2B 3B C CF COF DH LHP RHP RP SP SS Loading Try changing or resetting your filters to see more. 1 Shohei Ohtani Staff rankings 1 Law 1 Britton 1 Gleeman 1 Sarris 1 Bowden Profile Age 29 Position DH, RHP,SP Last team Los Angeles Angels Innings pitched 132 ERA+ 142 HR 44 OPS+ 184 Ohtani tops this list as a dual-position unicorn, but he\u2019d also top it purely as a hitter or a pitcher despite an elbow injury that will keep him off the mound in 2024. As a hitter from 2021-23, his .964 OPS was No. 2 in MLB behind only Aaron Judge. As a pitcher during that same period, his 2.84 ERA and strikeout rate of 11.4 per nine innings each ranked third for starters with at least 400 innings. Ohtani is unlike anything MLB has ever seen, with a legit case for being a top-five hitter and a top-five pitcher, which is absolutely bonkers. In the past three seasons, he produced 26.5 fWAR \u2014 15.5 as a hitter and 11.0 as a pitcher \u2014 a mind-bending total that breaks down to roughly $70 million a year in strictly on-field value. He\u2019s all but assured of securing the largest contract in MLB history. Buckle up. Team Outlook Single Double Triple Homer Lorem ipsum...This is where the text goes Data: fWAR from FanGraphs Britton's projection 12 years, $520 million Best fits LAD, NYM, SEA, SF Staff rankings 1 Law 1 Britton 1 Gleeman 1 Sarris 1 Bowden 3 year fWAR DH RHP SP 2 Aaron Nola 7 years $172 mil Profile Age 31 Position RHP, SP Last team Philadelphia Phillies Innings pitched 193 2/3 ERA+ 96 Over the last six seasons, Nola ranks first in the sport in games started, second in innings, third in strikeouts, and 15th in FIP (among pitchers with 100 starts). He has pitched at close to an ace level over that time, and he has been available all of that time. His last missed start due to injury was in May 2017. The rub for Nola is that, in two of the last three seasons, his ERA has been worse than the league average. When he struggled in 2021, Nola\u2019s peripheral stats suggested a bounceback was coming; he complied in 2022 to earn a fourth-place finish in the National League Cy Young Award voting. His peripherals aren\u2019t as rosy this year as they were then, although they are still better than league average. His strikeout rate is down a bit, and his walk rate moved back up after a career best last season. He served up a career-high 32 home runs in 2023. Player Outlook Single Double Triple Homer This is a no-brainer for Nola, who stays with the team that drafted him in 2014 and gets roughly $25 million per year through age 37 despite coming off a 4.46 ERA season. Seven years is the longest deal for a free-agent pitcher since Gerrit Cole and Stephen Strasburg in the 2019-2020 offseason, and Jacob deGrom (five years and $185 million last offseason) is the only free-agent starter to sign for more total money since then. \u2014 Aaron Gleeman Team Outlook Single Double Triple Homer Dave Dombrowski doesn\u2019t mess around. Contracts this big aren\u2019t normally signed this early in free agency, but Dombrowski doesn\u2019t care about normal when it comes to adding and keeping stars. Nola is now the Phillies\u2019 seventh player with an average annual salary of at least $20 million, joining Trea Turner, Bryce Harper, Zack Wheeler, J.T. Realmuto, Nick Castellanos and Kyle Schwarber. The Athletic'sTim Britton had projected a six-year, $180 million deal.\u2014 Aaron Gleeman Data: fWAR from FanGraphs Contract Details 7 years, $172 mil Staff rankings 3 Law 3 Britton 2 Gleeman 2 Sarris 4 Bowden 3 year fWAR RHP SP 3 Yoshinobu Yamamoto Staff rankings 4 Law 2 Britton 3 Gleeman 4 Sarris 2 Bowden Profile Age 25 Position RHP, SP Last team Orix Buffaloes (NPB) Innings pitched 171 ERA+ NPB Yamamoto will be the most prized pitcher on the open market for two reasons. First, he\u2019s posted better results in Nippon Professional Baseball than any pitcher who\u2019s ever signed in the majors. Second, he\u2019s only 25, making him an appealing option for teams that are both looking to win right away in 2024 and toward a sustained window of competitiveness beyond next year. Yamamoto has won the last three Eiji Sawamura awards \u2014 Japan\u2019s version of the Cy Young Award \u2014 and twice been named the Pacific League\u2019s most valuable player. Yamamoto works with a fastball that sits in the mid-90s and touches higher. His best secondary pitch is a splitter that dives off the table, and he utilizes an unorthodox grip on a tight curveball. Yamamoto has struck out opposing hitters about 50 percent more than the league average in Japan. A team signing Yamamoto will be subjected to a posting fee, paying 20 percent of the first $25 million, 17.5 percent of the next $25 million, and 15 percent of anything over $50 million. Photo: MLB Photos / Stringer Data: fWAR from FanGraphs Britton's projection 7 years, $203 million Best fits BOS, NYM, NYY, SF Staff rankings 4 Law 2 Britton 3 Gleeman 4 Sarris 2 Bowden 3 year fWAR RHP SP 4 Cody Bellinger Staff rankings 2 Law 4 Britton 5 Gleeman 5 Sarris 6 Bowden Profile Age 28 Position CF, 1B Last team Chicago Cubs HR 26 OPS+ 133 The only words that glide off a GM\u2019s mouth smoother than \u201crisk/reward\u201d are \u201csustainability\u201d and \u201copportunistic.\u201d So here is Bellinger, as risky a big-time reward as free agency has presented in some time. After a pair of bewilderingly poor seasons, Bellinger returned to being one of the game\u2019s premier players in 2023 on a pillow contract with the Cubs. He was the linchpin to an improved Chicago offense, propelling it into contention during one otherworldly stretch this summer and overall posting his best numbers since his MVP campaign in 2019 while patrolling center field most of the time. Bellinger is still only entering his age-28 season, and his ceiling is as a superstar capable of pairing top-flight offense with standout defense at a premium position. There\u2019s no other position player available in this market that can claim that. Bellinger has also shown a lower floor than most any free agent who\u2019s signed for the kind of deal he may land this winter, and his batted-ball data suggested his offensive results last season may have outpaced his input. Data: fWAR from FanGraphs Britton's projection 6 years, $162 million Best fits BOS, CHC, NYY, SF Staff rankings 2 Law 4 Britton 5 Gleeman 5 Sarris 6 Bowden 3 year fWAR CF 1B 5 Blake Snell Staff rankings 7 Law 5 Britton 4 Gleeman 3 Sarris 5 Bowden Profile Age 31 Position LHP, SP Last team San Diego Padres Innings pitched 180 ERA+ 182 Few pitchers have hit free agency coming off as dominant a stretch as Snell put together in his walk year: From the end of May on, he compiled a 1.20 ERA over 23 starts, blanking the opposition in 11 of those outings (and only twice allowing more than two runs). He is likely to claim his second Cy Young Award later this month and thus become just the seventh pitcher to win the award in both leagues. But \u201cwalk year\u201d was an apt way of describing Snell\u2019s season in multiple ways. He posted those remarkable results while also leading the league in walks; the last Cy Young Award winner to do that was Early Wynn in 1959. Because he goes to so many full counts, Snell rarely works beyond the sixth inning and averaged fewer than 5 2/3 innings per start this season. Data: fWAR from FanGraphs Britton's projection 5 years, $135 million Best fits LAD, SF, STL, TEX Staff rankings 7 Law 5 Britton 4 Gleeman 3 Sarris 5 Bowden 3 year fWAR LHP SP 6 Jordan Montgomery Staff rankings 6 Law 6 Britton 7 Gleeman 7 Sarris 3 Bowden Profile Age 31 Position LHP, SP Last team Texas Rangers Innings pitched 188 2/3 ERA+ 138 Montgomery\u2019s raw stuff doesn\u2019t excite and he was traded in back-to-back seasons, but he\u2019s quietly been one of MLB\u2019s most effective and durable starters since 2021. Getting ground balls with his sinker, and whiffs with curveballs and changeups, he joined Gerrit Cole and Kevin Gausman as the only pitchers with 30-plus starts and a sub-4.00 ERA in each of the past three seasons. Like most southpaws, Montgomery is death on left-handed hitters, but he also uses good command and two quality off-speed pitches to neutralize righties. It\u2019s not the sexiest profile for a pitcher set to cash in big at age 31, but Montgomery is a quality second or third option in a contending rotation and figures to be a lot of teams\u2019 top fallback plan in a relatively shallow market for starters. Data: fWAR from FanGraphs Britton's projection 5 years, $105 million Best fits BOS, LAD, NYM, TEX Staff rankings 6 Law 6 Britton 7 Gleeman 7 Sarris 3 Bowden 3 year fWAR LHP SP 7 Sonny Gray Staff rankings 5 Law 7 Britton 6 Gleeman 10 Sarris 10 Bowden Profile Age 34 Position RHP, SP Last team Minnesota Twins Innings pitched 184 ERA+ 154 Sick of nagging injuries limiting his workloads in otherwise strong seasons, Gray retooled his offseason routine at age 33 and posted his best ERA (2.79) in his most innings (184) since 2015. Gerrit Cole was the only pitcher in either league to throw more innings with a lower ERA, and Gray has a 3.22 ERA in 124 total starts since leaving the Yankees after 2018. Much of his 2023 success can be traced to allowing just eight homers, a rate of 0.4 per nine innings that led MLB and was roughly half of his career rate. He deserves credit for that, but it\u2019s also not sustainable. Any team signing Gray can expect more homers, and shouldn\u2019t bank on getting more than 400 or so innings on a three-year deal, but he\u2019s an established playoff-caliber starter with a deep pitch mix. Data: fWAR from FanGraphs Britton's projection 3 years, $72 million Best fits ATL, CIN, MIN, TEX Staff rankings 5 Law 7 Britton 6 Gleeman 10 Sarris 10 Bowden 3 year fWAR RHP SP 8 Matt Chapman Staff rankings 9 Law 9 Britton 9 Gleeman 6 Sarris 7 Bowden Profile Age 31 Position 3B Last team Toronto Blue Jays HR 17 OPS+ 108 Chapman\u2019s overall 2023 numbers are largely in line with career norms, but he got there in an odd, worrisome way. He had a monster April, hitting .384 with a 1.152 OPS. But then after May 1, he batted .205 with a .659 OPS in 113 games, including a sub-.650 OPS in four of the last five months. Soon to be 31, and with his last .800 OPS season in 2020, it\u2019s fair to wonder if his days of being an impact bat are over. His fielding remains elite, combining exceptional range with the arm strength and aggression to get outs on plays other third basemen wouldn\u2019t even attempt. Suitors offering Chapman big long-term deals will need to feel certain his defense will age gracefully. If it does, even being an average-ish hitter with 20-homer power would make him an All-Star-caliber all-around player. Data: fWAR from FanGraphs Britton's projection 5 years, $95 million Best fits ARZ, CHC, DET, TOR Staff rankings 9 Law 9 Britton 9 Gleeman 6 Sarris 7 Bowden 3 year fWAR 3B 9 Eduardo Rodr\u00edguez Staff rankings 8 Law 11 Britton 8 Gleeman 12 Sarris 11 Bowden Profile Age 31 Position LHP, SP Last team Detroit Tigers Innings pitched 152 2/3 ERA+ 134 Two offseasons ago, Rodriguez snagged a five-year, $77 million contract from the Tigers that included an opt-out after the second year. And despite personal reasons and injuries limiting him to 17 and 26 starts, opting out became a no-brainer for the 31-year-old lefty after posting a 3.58 ERA with Detroit. He should have little issue surpassing the three years and $49 million left on his original deal. Rodriguez sets batters up with his fastball and cutter, and puts them away with his trusty changeup, which allows him to neutralize righty bats better than most lefties. His lack of durability, time away from the Tigers in 2022 and headline-making veto of a midseason trade to the Dodgers could suppress Rodriguez\u2019s market somewhat, but he\u2019s a playoff-caliber lefty in a weaker free-agent starter class than last time. Data: fWAR from FanGraphs Britton's projection 5 years, $80 million Best fits ARZ, BOS, DET, MIN Staff rankings 8 Law 11 Britton 8 Gleeman 12 Sarris 11 Bowden 3 year fWAR LHP SP 10 Josh Hader Staff rankings 23 Law 8 Britton 10 Gleeman 8 Sarris 8 Bowden Profile Age 30 Position LHP, RP Last team San Diego Padres Innings pitched 56 1/3 ERA+ 321 For two months of the 2022 season, one of the game\u2019s most dominant closers broke. Over his last month as a Brewer and first as a Padre, Hader allowed 25 runs in 15 innings. Remove that stretch from his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and Hader owns a 1.96 ERA over the past six seasons, a stretch of remarkable dominance. Yes, his strikeout rate is down from the ridiculous high-40s rates he ran back in 2018 and 2019 to merely one of the top five in the sport, and his walk rate in 2023 was a new career worst. Under the hood, there are some reasons to be concerned that Hader can be as good as he has been, broadly, up to this point. But how many relievers would you trust more in a ninth inning right now than Hader? You\u2019re probably not counting on a second hand, and you may not be using all the fingers on the first. Data: fWAR from FanGraphs Britton's projection 4 years, $80 million Best fits LAD, PHI, STL, TEX Staff rankings 23 Law 8 Britton 10 Gleeman 8 Sarris 8 Bowden 3 year fWAR LHP RP 11 Marcus Stroman Staff rankings 11 Law 14 Britton 11 Gleeman 13 Sarris 14 Bowden Profile Age 33 Position RHP, SP Last team Chicago Cubs Innings pitched 136 2/3 ERA+ 113 On June 20, Stroman\u2019s 2.28 ERA led the National League, and he was a frontrunner for the Cy Young award. He\u2019d make only nine starts after that point, and he\u2019d post an even 9.00 ERA in those starts. A lot of that can probably be attributed to first a hip and then a rib-cage injury that knocked Stroman out of action for six weeks and meant an initial return to the bullpen in September as he built back up. However, it\u2019s the second straight season in which injuries have limited Stroman to fewer than 140 innings total, and his performance when on the field has been a step back from what it was during his best years with the Blue Jays and Mets. His walk rate in 2023 was a career high. Still, as long as he\u2019s healthy, Stroman should pitch in the top half of a rotation. Data: fWAR from FanGraphs Britton's projection 3 years, $63 million Best fits BOS, KC, LAA, PHI Staff rankings 11 Law 14 Britton 11 Gleeman 13 Sarris 14 Bowden 3 year fWAR RHP SP 12 Shota Imanaga Staff rankings 12 Law 21 Britton 14 Gleeman 11 Sarris 22 Bowden Profile Age 30 Position LHP, SP Last team Yokohama DeNA BayStars (NPB) Innings pitched 159 ERA+ NPB While Yoshinobu Yamamoto has stolen most of the headlines, Imanaga had his own breakout earlier this year in the World Baseball Classic. He\u2019s the left-hander who started the championship game against the United States. In three appearances in the WBC, Imanaga allowed two runs in six innings, striking out seven. Imanaga was not quite as dominant in 2023 as he had been in 2022; nevertheless, over the past three seasons his ERA in NPB has been about 38 percent better than the league average there. That\u2019s in line with pitchers like Hiroki Kuroda and Hisashi Iwakuma before they signed in the majors. A team signing Imanaga will be subjected to a posting fee, paying 20 percent of the first $25 million, 17.5 percent of the next $25 million, and 15 percent of anything over $50 million.

Until that point, Hoskins had been a steady and productive presence in the middle of the Philadelphia order, consistently posting an OPS+ around 125 and approaching 30 homers each season. The knee injury creates some questions, but maybe fewer than it would if Hoskins were expected to patrol, say, center field. He should still be able to play first base, and in a bad free-agent market for position players, he\u2019s a guy who can fit a lot of different rosters \u2014 contending teams in need of a middle-of-the-order bat, teams coming up that could use a veteran presence, rebuilding teams looking to flip someone at the deadline for prospects. That could include a return to the Phillies, depending on where they want to play Bryce Harper long-term.

As they did with Kyle Schwarber before, the Nationals turned a one-year deal with Candelario into on-field production and a mid-season trade. Candelario hopes that translates into a similar multiyear payday. While the primary statistics were right in line or better with his production in 2021 or the abbreviated 2020 season, Candelario\u2019s underlying metrics were a little less positive this time around. Still, that\u2019s three seasons in the past four he\u2019s delivered solid if not quite spectacular results while playing a decent third base. For a team with a need on either corner of the infield, Candelario is a strong option behind Matt Chapman.

Giolito still missed plenty of bats, but he served up a whopping 41 homers in 184 1/3 innings. At age 29, he\u2019s one of the most obvious rebound candidates among prominent free agents. Giolito received Cy Young Award votes in 2019, 2020 and 2021, and his strikeout and walk rates have slipped only slightly since then. But any team willing to spend big money on Giolito for multiple years must be sure his once-excellent changeup is still a potential weapon rather than just part of the homer-allowing problem.

A team signing Lee will be subjected to a posting fee, paying 20 percent of the first $25 million, 17.5 percent of the next $25 million, and 15 percent of anything over $50 million.

The usual prime years of 27 through 29, though, were rough on Wacha. He was well below league average in all three, on the cusp of washing out of major-league rotations entirely. After altering his repertoire as a Ray in 2021, Wacha has seen significantly better results over the past two seasons with Boston and San Diego. He\u2019s gone 25-6 in that time, throwing about 130 innings each season with an ERA 27 percent better than the league average. Wacha has pitched for five different teams over the past five years.

Given that chance with the Padres, he justified all of it. He threw nearly as many innings in 2023 as he had in the previous three combined, and he did so at a 3.57 ERA. Lugo\u2019s carrying pitch has always been his curveball, an early Statcast darling because of its absurd spin rate. But he owns a broad mix that included a slider he was working on as last season progressed. Lugo\u2019s relative lack of innings leading into 2023 can be looked at as a positive (his arm is far fresher than most guys at 34) or a negative (how does his arm recover from the increased workload). In a market with a lot of similar veteran arms, Lugo stands out for his unique upside at 34.

He\u2019s hit as many as 48 long balls in a season, and he\u2019s averaged a home run every 20 plate appearances over the past three seasons. The power is no fluke: Soler hits the ball as hard as most anyone in the sport, and as often. The downsides are just as clear. He played just 89 games in the outfield over the past two seasons for Miami, and he didn\u2019t play it well. He\u2019s vulnerable to extended cold streaks in which he strikes out about 30 percent of the time.

Hern\u00e1ndez has an MLB-leading .626 slugging percentage versus lefties since 2020, hitting .312 with 32 homers in 414 at-bats. During that time, Aaron Judge and Paul Goldschmidt are the only other regulars to slug over .600 against lefties.

Gurriel\u2019s strengths are in putting the ball in play and punishing sliders. He swings a lot but misses less than most, thanks to his ability to put the bat on the ball.

But his right-handed power and plate discipline make an undeniable impact whenever, and wherever, he\u2019s in the lineup. His combined .826 OPS since 2021 is 19th among right-handed hitters, sandwiched between Xander Bogaerts and Nolan Arenado. Garver started just 41 games behind the plate in two seasons with Texas, including only one start there after Sept. 1 last season. That suggests he should be seen as a designated hitter who can occasionally catch, but a healthy Garver is good enough to make a big impact in a bat-first role.

Yeah, still pretty good. The big question around Kershaw, of course, is the health of his left shoulder. He looked diminished over the final seven weeks of the regular season as a five-and-dive starter and like a shell of himself when getting hammered in the Division Series. He underwent surgery on that shoulder last week, saying only that he was hopeful of playing sometime in the summer.

Even while thriving in the second half, Maeda\u2019s average fastball was barely above 90 mph, but he\u2019s never relied on big-time velocity and his splitter-slider off-speed combo continues to baffle hitters. Counting on Maeda for more than 125 innings is probably a mistake at this point, and he can\u2019t afford to lose any more oomph on his fastball.

His production slipped slightly in the second half, but Turner has gas left in the tank based on his ability to control the strike zone by rarely chasing and making consistent, solid contact when he swings. There\u2019s always a lot of competition in the first baseman/designated hitter pool, and Turner will almost surely have to settle for a one-year contract given his age, but he should be a popular target for contending teams looking to boost the lineup without having to make a long-term commitment.

Stephenson had a 4.91 career ERA before the deal. Tampa Bay tweaked Stephenson\u2019s oft-used slider into a more cutter-like offering he threw nearly 70 percent of the time, with amazing results.

Seasons like Pham\u2019s for a 35-year-old are more often dead-cat bounces than full-on revivals. Pham, however, could argue that a late-spring change in contact lenses was a primary driver of his on-field improvement and thus a reason it can be sustained. (He has keratoconus, an eye condition that can blur vision.) A year after his strikeout rate spiked and his walk rate plunged, Pham brought both back closer to his career norms.

It was a shocking collapse for a 30-year-old coming off four straight seasons hitting above .300. Anderson\u2019s value has always revolved around batting average, because he swings at everything and has middling power, which makes last season\u2019s jump in strikeout rate especially worrisome.

Last season\u2019s 88.6 mph average fastball velocity was one of the lowest among all starters, but even at his best (and healthiest) Ryu barely threw over 90.

Over the last two years with the Dodgers and Phillies, he has reasserted himself as, if not one of the game\u2019s most historically dominant closers, at least a capable closer for a winning team. Kimbrel\u2019s gotten back to himself by reining in a walk rate that had climbed to untenable heights. (It\u2019s still not ideal.) He needs to be able to command his fastball in the zone to generate chase with his all-world curveball. At 36, he\u2019s probably back in the market for another one-year deal, again appealing to good teams with a high-leverage need late.

Not bad for a guy released by the Cubs entering what would have been the final year of his eight-year contract with the club. Heyward has long been known for his defense and his leadership. He\u2019s a useful player when his offense is right around league average, let alone above it the way it was in 2023. Even as he\u2019ll be 34 next season, he can do more than stand in center field and he remains a very good defender in the corners.

It may seem like he should still be in the middle of his peak, but Merrifield was a late bloomer, debuting for the Royals at age 27. Now he\u2019s 35 and hasn\u2019t posted an OPS above league average since 2020, with declining speed and fielding flexibility. He\u2019s still fast, but Merrifield\u2019s sprint speed has dropped from the 94th percentile to the 85th percentile. He led the league by going 40-for-44 on steals in 2021, but he\u2019s 42-for-57 in 284 games since, in part because he\u2019s no longer as able to get on base. Merrifield remains a high-end role player capable of manning second base and all three outfield spots, but he\u2019s no longer an everyday, top-of-the-lineup asset.

Instead, he made just five more starts for Philadelphia, with an ERA approaching eight across them, and got shifted to the pen for the rest of September and October. Since shifting back to the rotation in 2022, Lorenzen\u2019s ERA is a hair better than league average, with a strikeout rate well below. He did really improve his walk rate and the effectiveness of the fastball, which is to say there are tools here for a pitcher with less wear on his arm than most at 32.

          "text": "Israeli soldiers detained blindfolded Palestinian men on Sunday near a road in the Gaza City area where other Palestinians were evacuating to the south.\n\nA celebrated Palestinian poet and essayist who founded the Gaza Strip\u2019s first English-language library was released by Israel on Tuesday, two days after he was detained as his family was fleeing to southern Gaza on foot.\n\nThe poet, Mosab Abu Toha, was taken to a detention center in the Negev desert in southern Israel, said Diana Buttu, a family friend who spoke to him soon after he was released in Gaza at the same spot where he was first detained. She said he was likely freed because of public pressure, including from publications like The New Yorker magazine, which Mr. Abu Toha has contributed to, and the free speech organization PEN America.\n\n\u201cHe was interrogated and he was actually beaten,\u201d Ms. Buttu said. \u201cThey hit him in the stomach. They hit him in the face several times.\u201d\n\nThe Israeli military confirmed that he was among several civilians taken in for questioning and he was then released. It did not immediately comment on the allegations that he had been beaten.\n\nDozens of other families who have arrived in central and southern Gaza have reported that their sons, husbands and fathers, who they said had no connection to armed Palestinian groups, have vanished after being stopped by Israel\u2019s military along the evacuation route for those fleeing northern Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli military said it had apprehended 300 people during the ground invasion that began more than three weeks ago and said that they were connected to armed groups, adding that they \u201cwere brought into Israeli territory for further interrogations.\u201d Those interrogations had led Israeli forces to the locations of underground tunnels, warehouses and weapons in Gaza, according to the military.\n\nMr. Abu Toha told Ms. Buttu that he was taken on Sunday along with more than 100 other Palestinians in Israeli military vehicles and driven into southern Israel, all while they were blindfolded. He did not see anyone else being released at the same time as he was, Ms. Buttu said.\n\n\u201cAs he was leaving, the Israelis were bringing more people in,\u201d she added.\n\nAfter his release, he had to make his way down south along the evacuation road until he reached the central Gaza town of Deir al-Balah, Ms. Buttu said. He roamed the streets until he saw someone he recognized and asked about his family, who arrived in the town on Sunday.\n\nMr. Abu Toha, 31, his wife, three children and his brother-in-law had left a school where they were sheltering in northern Gaza on Sunday and joined thousands of others walking south with what few possessions they could carry, according to his wife, Maram Abu Toha, and her brother, Ibrahim May.\n\nThe family was on a State Department evacuation list and they were making their way to the Rafah border crossing with Egypt in southern Gaza on Sunday when Mr. Abu Toha was taken, the relatives said. But when he was released on Tuesday, the Israelis had taken his and his family\u2019s passports, Ms. Buttu said.\n\nIsraeli forces have taken over much of northern Gaza and ordered residents to move south as part of an air and land assault that followed the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas, the armed Palestinian group that controls Gaza. Of Gaza\u2019s 2.3 million residents, some 1.7 million have been displaced since the start of the war, according to the United Nations.\n\nImage Mosab Abu Toha, a Palestinian poet and essayist, in a photo taken in September. Credit... Diana Buttu\n\nHuman rights organizations say they are trying to ascertain how many Palestinians from Gaza have been detained and where they are being held.\n\n\u201cReports of Israel detaining scores of those fleeing raises further serious concerns,\u201d said Omar Shakir, Human Rights Watch\u2019s Israel and Palestine director. \u201cCivilians may only be detained when absolutely necessary for imperative reasons of security.\u201d\n\nRecounting the events of Sunday when her husband was detained, Ms. Abu Toha said that as the family walked past Israeli troops and tanks, soldiers called out to dozens of the men and ordered them to approach for questioning. Their families were forced to keep walking, she added, echoing similar accounts by other Palestinian families.\n\nWhen they called on Mr. Abu Toha, he was carrying his 3-year-old son Mustafa, his wife said.\n\n\u201cI was in front of him by three meters and they told him, drop the kid and come toward the military,\u201d Ms. Abu Toha said. \u201cMustafa was calling out to his dad.\u201d\n\nShe ran back to get her son, she said, risking being shot by Israeli soldiers.\n\n\u201cWalk quickly or else I will shoot you,\u201d she said a soldier yelled at her. \u201cAnd then really, as we walked a bit, he started shooting on the road and the wall.\u201d\n\nThe Israeli military did not respond to questions about reports that it was shooting at or toward evacuees.\n\nMr. Abu Toha\u2019s family had no information about his whereabouts since he vanished on Sunday and was not even certain that he had been detained until they saw him on Tuesday .\n\nIn 2017, Mr. Abu Toha opened the English-language Edward Said Library in northern Gaza.",

          "text": "The state of Israel was born in war. The year before its founding in 1948, the United Nations produced a partition plan that proposed to divide the stretch of land from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea into two states, Arab and Jewish. The surrounding Arab countries rejected the plan, as did Palestinians living on the land. And on May 15, a day after Israel declared itself a state, four Arab countries attacked. Jewish Israelis saw the ensuing war, which they won, as an existential fight for survival, one that came just a few years after the Holocaust. To Palestinians, 1948 marked the Nakba, or catastrophe, in which 700,000 people fled or were forcibly expelled from their homes. Many went to the West Bank, where Jordan took control, or the Gaza Strip, which Egypt occupied.\n\nBarbed wire covering the roadway in Jerusalem at Zion Square on May 19, 1948, during the Arab-Israeli war. Associated Press Photo\n\nChronic conflict followed. So too did periodic efforts to resolve it. None brought lasting peace. Negotiations between Israel and Palestinians barely existed for decades, and subsequent military conflicts made the situation more difficult. When Egypt mobilized troops on the border in 1967, Israel launched pre-emptive airstrikes, and in a war fought in six days against a coalition of Arab states, Israel took over contested territory, beginning a military occupation in the West Bank and Gaza. Many Palestinians, living under occupation or as refugees around the world, still saw the founding of Israel as an act of dispossession that had robbed them of their land and homes. In 1968, when Yasir Arafat became chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the group\u2019s charter called the establishment of Israel illegal and sanctioned armed resistance in what it saw as a struggle for liberation. Some P.L.O. factions conducted bombings, hijackings and other attacks, including the killing of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich. As a result, Israel refused to negotiate with the P.L.O., considering it a terrorist group.\n\nPalestinian refugees carrying their belongings as they prepared to cross the wrecked Allenby Bridge over the Jordan River from the Israeli-occupied section of Jordan, 1967. Bernard Frye/Associated Press Photo\n\nA political shift began in the late 1980s. With Arafat and other P.L.O. leaders in exile in Tunisia, Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza mounted a locally led popular uprising in December 1987. Television footage of the First Intifada (which means \u201cshaking off\u201d in Arabic) showed Israeli soldiers beating children throwing stones, eroding Israel\u2019s international standing.\n\nOver the following years, with Israel and the P.L.O. under pressure for different reasons, momentum built for the two sides to negotiate a resolution. An opportunity for something unprecedented began to take shape: the first direct dialogue between Israel and the P.L.O. and what would become their most sustained effort to reach a settlement. This was known as the Oslo peace process, named for the city where the secret talks took place. It ran through most of the 1990s and came as close as any negotiated process ever has to resolving this intractable conflict. In the end, Oslo failed. The reasons for that failure \u2014 and the lessons it has to teach us \u2014 have been debated ever since.\n\nWe assembled a panel of scholars and experts \u2014 three Palestinian, three Israeli and an American \u2014 to help us understand the history of Oslo: Was it a genuine chance for peace? Was it doomed from the start? Why did it unravel?\n\nThis conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity, with some material reordered and added from follow-up interviews.\n\nPart 1: The Road to Oslo\n\nGaza City\u2019s Palestine Square in May 1993, one of the bloodiest months of the First Intifada. Larry Towell/Magnum Photos Israeli settlements near Jerusalem, 1991. Abbas/Magnum Photos The First Intifada, December 1987. Micha Bar-Am/Magnum Photos Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel during the the Middle East peace conference in Madrid, 1991. Jerome Delay/Associated Press Photo\n\nIn the 1990s, the international order in the Middle East realigned as a result of the gulf war. When Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait, most Arab countries joined the U.S.-led coalition to push them out. The P.L.O., however, backed Hussein. The decision cost the P.L.O. the financial and diplomatic backing of many of its Arab allies.\n\nPresident George H.W. Bush and his secretary of state, James A. Baker III, saw an opening for international intervention. In October 1991, the United States and the Soviet Union hosted the Madrid peace conference, with delegations from Israel, Lebanon and Syria, as well as a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation. The gathering represented a breakthrough, but it did not include the P.L.O. Yitzhak Shamir, Israel\u2019s prime minister, objected to the group\u2019s presence, and Arab countries went along with his wishes.\n\nThese contradictions led Palestinians to seek a second track for talks and eventually to go to Oslo.\n\nSo the Palestinians were in the midst of a shift about how to approach their engagement with Israel.\n\nBaker tried hard to pressure Shamir in the Madrid negotiations. He threatened to withhold $10 billion in loan guarantees unless Israel stopped building settlements in the territories, which became a big issue in Israel. And this helped enable Yitzhak Rabin to come to power in 1992.\n\nFor Rabin, who had the ethos of standing fast and not yielding, this was for him Israeli society going soft \u2014 not cowardice, but softness. He sensed that Israelis are sick and tired of wars.\n\nKurtzer: Let\u2019s start with why Rabin was attracted to backchannel negotiations at all. That was not easy for him. There were no senior leaders in Israel until that time \u2014 other than Shimon Peres, the foreign minister \u2014 who were ready to negotiate with or recognize the P.L.O. as the representative of the Palestinian people. Rabin, as Mr. Security, was certainly not in favor of it.\n\nMargalit: All the Israeli leaders who negotiated for peace, starting with Rabin, were in a weak political position. Rabin\u2019s coalition had only a slim majority of 62 out of 120 seats in the Knesset, and it depended on a religious party. Some of its leaders were pretty dovish, but their voters were not, or that was the perception.\n\nInbar: Rabin was under political pressure to succeed. He was not a very successful prime minister in his previous stint in the 1970s. Also, he viewed the international circumstances as very beneficial for having such an agreement. America was the winner of the Cold War, and we were America\u2019s ally. The P.L.O. was weak, because it had sided with Saddam Hussein, and Rabin preferred to deal with it when it was weak, not when it was strong.\n\nKurtzer: The negotiations in Washington that followed Madrid didn\u2019t go anywhere. And Rabin was torn. In February 1993, when academics were talking to the P.L.O. and Oslo had begun, Rabin came to Washington on an official visit. He asked to meet with us, members of the U.S. peace team, but not the secretary of state, which was unusual. He conducted a soliloquy: The P.L.O. is out to destroy us, but on the other hand, only Arafat can make decisions. When he walked out after 45 minutes, we looked at each other and said, This man is ready to figure out how to talk to the P.L.O.\n\nPart 2: The Oslo Agreement\n\nFrom left: Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, King Hussein of Jordan, President Bill Clinton and the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat in September 1995, at the signing of the West Bank autonomy agreement between Israel and the P.L.O. at the White House.

Gary Hershon/Reuters, via Redux\n\nThe two sides agreed not to discuss the past. They exchanged draft proposals. The negotiating teams grew to include other P.L.O. officials and representatives of Israel\u2019s Labor Party government. Abu Alaa stressed economic cooperation and the progression from easier issues to harder ones, to build trust. Rabin and Arafat, whom the negotiators called the grandfathers, began monitoring the talks closely.\n\nThe two sides agreed to a \u201cdeclaration of principles,\u201d known as the Oslo Accord, which set the terms for further peace negotiations, with the promise of a permanent resolution within five years \u2014 more than anyone had achieved before. In the unprecedented agreement, Arafat, on behalf of the Palestinian people, recognized Israel\u2019s right to live in peace and security and agreed to renounce the use of terrorism or any other form of violence. Rabin recognized the P.L.O. as the official representative of the Palestinian people. The accord also included promises of Israeli withdrawals from Gaza and part of the West Bank, of elections for Palestinian self-governance and of a permanent resolution, based on the principle of land for peace in U.N. Resolution 242.\n\nOn Sept. 13, 1993, Rabin and Arafat met for the first time for the signing of the Oslo Accord on the White House lawn. With a nudge from a beaming President Bill Clinton, they shook hands. \u201cWe the soldiers who have returned from the battle stained with blood,\u201d Rabin, a former general, said in a speech, \u201cwe who have fought against you, the Palestinians, we say to you today in a loud and clear voice: \u2018Enough of blood and tears! Enough!\u2019\u201d Arafat spoke in a similar register: \u201cOur two peoples are awaiting today this historic hope, and they want to give peace a real chance.\u201d\n\nBazelon: In that famous moment on the White House lawn, what hopes did people have? What seemed possible?\n\nDajani: With the First Intifada, and then subsequently Madrid and Oslo, Palestinians suddenly see the possibility of agency. There is this idea that Palestinians would not allow themselves to be marginalized from the process of deciding the fate of their homeland.\n\nThere is a feeling during this juncture that independence is just around the bend. Palestinians having made this historic compromise in 1988, with the Declaration of Independence, and effectively having said, All right, we agree to the establishment of a Palestinian state, alongside Israel, which means 78 percent of what Palestinians regarded as historic Palestine would not be part of that state. Having made that compromise, Palestinians, to a great extent, had the sense that independence and the end of occupation were imminent, that these processes in which they were participating directly were going to yield a completely new reality.\n\nBut at the same time Ashrawi says they all knew the P.L.O. was in a weakened position. For her and others, supporting Oslo was the price to pay for moving the peace process forward and for giving the P.L.O. a new lease on life.\n\nKurtzer: The Oslo agreement was full of holes. The mutual recognition was asymmetrical, and that was to hurt the Palestinian negotiating position for years to come.\n\nBefore, the conflict was always described as Arab-Israeli, and people in Israel would say, Well, they have 22 Arab countries. But now we are recognizing a unique Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nAll the time, comparisons are made to the peace process with Egypt or Jordan or even Syria. However, those are disputes over borders involving Israel and another state. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict, on the other hand, is of a different nature. It revolves around conflicting demands for self-determination, which both sides perceive as a zero-sum game, evoking feelings of existential threat and profound insecurity.\n\nYehuda: Yes. Until the 1990s, we had freedom of movement. When I was young, Palestinians were traveling or working or driving with their cars inside Israel, and Israelis were going to Gaza and to the West Bank.\n\nBazelon: Efraim, were you hopeful about the Oslo Accord at the outset?\n\nInbar: We hoped the deal was simple. This was the deal between Rabin and Arafat, and nobody should tell you anything else: You get land. We didn\u2019t expect peace. We wanted you to keep away the terrorists from us. Just like with Egypt, with Jordan, we hoped that the embryonic Palestinian state will be able to have a monopoly over the use of force. And then there would be no terrorism.\n\nBy the way, there is a wider problem in the region of establishing states that have a monopoly on the use of force. Look at Sudan, at Libya, at Yemen, Iraq and Syria. You don\u2019t have to accept my analysis. But what\u2019s important to understand is that the notion of peace for Rabin, and for most Israelis, is that peace is a lack of violence from the other side. Leave us alone. We don\u2019t want violence.\n\nPart 3: Threats to Oslo\n\nPalestinian and Israeli soldiers in 1994, awaiting the arrival of new Palestinian police officers in Gaza at the Rafah crossing near the Egyptian border.

Abbas/Magnum Photos\n\nViolence and extremism quickly threatened the Oslo Accord. Only five months after the signing at the White House, in February 1994, an American-born settler, Baruch Goldstein, opened fire on Palestinians who were praying during Ramadan at the Ibrahimi Mosque in the West Bank city Hebron, killing 29 people and wounding about 125 more. The Jewish supremacism to which Goldstein ascribed called for dominion over all of the land of Judea and Samaria, the biblical term for the West Bank, and treated any withdrawal as anathema.\n\nBazelon: What effect did the Hebron massacre have?\n\nShikaki: That was a turning point, as far as the Palestinian public was concerned. The reaction of the Israeli government to the Palestinians showed that the political leadership in Israel, including Rabin, was too weak to take any significant measures to deal with the settlers, to evacuate settlers, for example.\n\nDajani: In the moment following the massacre, the Israeli government could have said, We are going to signal to the settler movement that we are shifting away from the dangerous messianic nationalism Baruch Goldstein represented. Imagine the gesture it would have represented to Palestinians if Israel had removed the Jewish settlement in the heart of Hebron first, knowing that it would never be feasible to have a two-state solution with that remaining. How much more difficult would it have been for Hamas to justify the attacks it commenced in the months that followed?\n\nBarring Israel taking that path, the United States could have said, To ensure Oslo realizes its potential, we will have a third-party force on the ground in Hebron to stabilize things and ensure protection of civilians. That was similarly a missed opportunity.\n\nInstead, a completely toothless U.N. observer mission was created, which had no role other than to literally watch what was happening and write it down.\n\nShikaki: The violence immediately brought about a significant rise in support for Hamas that was temporary but sufficient to give Hamas the strength it needed to be able to carry out large-scale violence to destroy whatever was being achieved.\n\nYehuda: Matti Steinberg, a former top adviser to the Shin Bet security service, told Rabin in March 1994 that he\u2019d better move straight to the talks on a permanent resolution.\n\nInbar: What is most important, and people do not realize it, is that all Rabin\u2019s intelligence officers, including the chief of intelligence, told him in not so many words, The Palestinians are preparing for war.\n\nRabin was Mr. Security, and he was really authoritative, and probably only Rabin could have convinced the Israelis to take the risk needed to make a deal with the Palestinians.\n\nInbar: But building settlements isn\u2019t a violation of the accords. Maybe you mean a violation of the American or Palestinian understanding. But in the agreement, there is nothing written against expanding settlements.\n\nDajani: I think that Palestinians thought oblique statements in the Oslo Accord about preserving the status and integrity of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip would be enough to mean that no settlements would be built during the interim period, especially based upon assurances they felt that they had received orally by Israeli leaders in the negotiations \u2014 the sorts of things that as a contracts professor, I might have cautioned against.\n\nMargalit: The underlying understanding of the Oslo agreement was that Rabin was committed to go on. That he was the most trusted person among the people who supported Oslo and that he would be there carrying on the future stages of the agreement. And then his assassination obliterated this.\n\nShikaki: For Palestinians, the decline of support and optimism for the Oslo process was certainly consolidated in 1996 by the election of Netanyahu. Economic conditions in the West Bank and Gaza somewhat improved. Gross national product rose, with laborers working in Israel and businesses opening in Palestinian areas. But it was not enough to increase per-capita income, so it didn\u2019t really have significant benefits for normal people. Most of the economic benefits went to Israelis, and people could see that.\n\nBazelon: Netanyahu governed from the right but continued with the Oslo framework. In 1998, he and Arafat signed another agreement, with Clinton as mediator, which provided for further Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank and for Palestinians to take specific steps to prevent terrorist attacks. But terrorism continued, and Israel postponed most of the withdrawal. In the end, the two sides breached the agreements signed in the 1990s. What effect did that have?\n\nEl Kurd: I think it exacerbated the dynamic that Dr. Shikaki mentioned. It seemed to the Palestinians, by 1996 especially, that the Oslo peace process was an attempt to reorder the status quo, to give Palestinians something less than a state and to avoid backlash.\n\nI also think it\u2019s important to note that the Oslo Accord not only inserted the P.L.O. leadership into the West Bank and Gaza from the outside but also hollowed out the civil society and grass-roots organizations, like women\u2019s groups and agricultural groups, which engaged in the First Intifada. Western donors wound up undermining the Palestinian women\u2019s movement by misunderstanding it and not recognizing how much women were adversely affected by the ongoing military occupation, as the political scientist Manal Jamal has described.\n\nDajani: Despite the serious design flaws in Oslo, I don\u2019t think today\u2019s reality was an inevitable consequence. I think the U.S. could have played a useful role in compensating for the accords\u2019 weaknesses.\n\nOne of the biggest problems was that there was no mechanism for third-party dispute resolution. Palestinians thought that the international community, and the United States in particular, would step in to ensure that the obligations of Israel were being implemented in good faith. And again and again, what the United States chose to do instead was to leave Israeli leaders with discretion, by blocking efforts in the U.N. Security Council to censure Israel for continuing settlement activity.\n\nKurtzer: I thought we would bend toward Israel on security and bend toward Palestinians on territory and governance. In other words, to assure Palestinians a serious state while finding ways to address Israel\u2019s legitimate security concerns when they would have to give up those territories. But the U.S. negotiators didn\u2019t do that.\n\nIn practical terms, you can see it in a book written by Dennis Ross, who was Clinton\u2019s chief negotiator, where he admits that the negotiating methodology that he and his colleagues pursued was to work out agreements with Israel and then to try to market them to the Palestinians. So you had something that was later called America acting as Israel\u2019s lawyer. And as Omar suggested, there were no monitoring mechanisms to hold anyone accountable.\n\nYehuda: Oslo was supposed to build trust. It did the opposite.\n\nPart 4: Camp David Summit\n\nPresident Bill Clinton meeting with Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Yasir Arafat in July 2000 at Camp David, Md.

Larry Towell/Magnum Photos\n\nIn May 1999, with post-Oslo negotiations stalled, Israeli voters once again elected a would-be peacemaker. Ehud Barak, Rabin\u2019s heir as leader of the Labor Party, defeated Netanyahu, whose coalition split over implementing his agreement to withdraw more troops from the West Bank.\n\nLike Rabin, Barak didn\u2019t have a strong coalition \u2014 the peace camp in the Knesset held only 36 of 120 seats. Barak decided that in contrast to the incremental process of Oslo, he would make an all-out push for a final peace agreement. He pressed for a speedy round of negotiations followed by a one-time summit with Clinton as host.\n\nBazelon: How did the prospects look for Camp David?\n\nDajani: I arrived in Israel-Palestine in the fall of 1999. It was my first time to visit the place, and I was there as a legal adviser as part of the team that was assembled to support the Palestinian negotiating team in the peace talks. And I think that the Israeli electoral politics are worth noting for just a second. We were coming out of several years of a Netanyahu-led government in Israel and the sense of deep immobility with regard to the things Palestinians expected the peace process to deliver. And I remember very vividly how optimistic we were about Barak taking the helm.\n\nIn November and December of 1999, we begin the discussions. Ehud Barak starts off by saying that U.N. Resolution 242 \u2014 land for peace, at the 1967 lines \u2014 doesn\u2019t apply to the West Bank. And so suddenly, what we heard was, Oh, wait a minute, a main basis for negotiations is inapplicable. And as the negotiations proceeded in the first half of 2000, those anxieties deepened. I remember, just to cite one example, entering into a round of negotiations in spring 2000, and it was the first point at which the Israeli delegation presented a map of what a territorial settlement might look like. It was quite extraordinary: 30 percent of the West Bank was under continuing Israeli control, and all of the settlements in that map were under Israeli control, even the settlement inside Hebron.\n\nWhat we were expecting was that almost all of the West Bank would be transferred to Palestinian sovereignty. What we were seeing instead was a fairly limited contiguity between Palestinian areas. And the American team is doing very little to place any kinds of guardrails around this process.\n\nSo I think it is true that once we began discussions in earnest, it was possible for us to start to make progress. But I would just say, Emily, that Barak\u2019s approach seemed to be to decide what was good for them and for us, and to lay it out as kind of a proposition to be accepted or refused rather than one to be negotiated. During the Camp David talks, it was very difficult for us to recognize what seemed to be a bargaining maneuver versus what seem to be Israel\u2019s positions, in part because he was so forcefully arguing that his coalition agreement and Israeli politics more broadly were constraining his ability to maneuver.\n\nBazelon: The offers at Camp David were not written down, and there are competing interpretations of what happened. Dennis Ross, the lead U.S. negotiator, said on NPR recently, about Camp David: \u201cWe moved the Israelis a lot. But Arafat \u2014 even though I would talk to him and he would say his negotiators were authorized to negotiate, they didn\u2019t actually do so.\u201d According to Ross, Arafat said no to the offers on the table.\n\nKurtzer: Look, Camp David was what we call in American football a poorly prepared Hail Mary. Nobody was ready. The American team had to call for reinforcements to discuss Jerusalem and refugees because there had not really been serious discussions on that previously. Arafat didn\u2019t want to go to Camp David. I was ambassador to Egypt at the time, and I had to go see Hosni Mubarak to pressure Arafat. Arafat only went because Mubarak pressed him to go. And then the United States ended up blaming Arafat for the failure of Camp David.\n\nMargalit: Actually, the Israelis were well prepared for the negotiations but ill prepared to deal with Jerusalem. There are two things that the Israelis realized are important to the Palestinian, to Arafat\u2019s, narrative. The return of the refugees and the Temple Mount.\n\nIt became clear that Arafat could give up on the refugees\u2019 return if he gets sovereignty over the Temple Mount. And it was clear that the Israelis won\u2019t take refugees into Israel, apart from a symbolic number, because of the demographic fear of losing the Jewish majority. Maybe it can work, but maybe you have hostility between the two communities and end up in a civil war, like in Lebanon.\n\nShikaki: To a large extent, Arafat knew that the deal on refugees was not doable. There was no way he would get any actual return, and he made peace with that. However, he needed to be able to legitimize the package by having sovereignty over Haram al-Sharif. And I think that is what Arafat wanted.\n\nUnfortunately, Camp David was proposed as a one-shot deal, make it or break it. And that was the huge mistake. Had this been one of various meetings and discussions, things would have been easier.\n\nSo overall, I think for Arafat, a deal without sovereignty over holy places would be a deal that he cannot sell. In his mind, being able to go to Haram al-Sharif and have a photo while praying, this was the most important legitimating piece of diplomacy that he needed to sell a peace deal to the Palestinians.\n\nKurtzer: Barak\u2019s proposal was more than the Palestinians had ever seen before, but it fell far short of their absolute minimum. They believed when they accepted a two-state solution in 1988, that they already had given up 78 percent of Palestine. To be asked in Camp David to give up more, and not to be given what they needed on Jerusalem or minimally on refugees \u2014 all these issues boiling after Oslo came to a head at Camp David.\n\nThe biggest single issue was Arafat\u2019s failure to put forward an alternative. Israelis came to negotiate. Arafat never really entered into negotiations.\n\nShikaki: The Americans didn\u2019t really have a vision of their own to present to the parties as they sat down at the table.\n\nInbar: From an Israeli perspective, Barak made incredible concessions at Camp David. Particularly, he violated the taboo on dividing Jerusalem, which in the Israeli psyche is really important.\n\nAnd generally the expectation of the Palestinians that they will get 100 percent of their demands \u2014 and I understand that they feel that they just get less than 22 percent of the territory \u2014 is something that is not realistic. The Israelis saw it as another sign that they will get from Palestinians a two-stage strategy: First they get one part of the territory, and then there will be more struggle.\n\nEl Kurd: What comes up for me is that the Palestinian public can be forced to disregard their national aspirations. From my understanding, at Camp David, there\u2019s not enough information for the Palestinian negotiating team. There is no movement on the right of return, as has been mentioned. There\u2019s not enough movement on Jerusalem. So why would the Palestinian negotiating team agree with any of this? At the end of the day, it seems like the peace process was predicated on the idea that something could be forced on the Palestinian people.\n\nBazelon: Despite the violence that fall, the U.S. team worked on what became the Clinton parameters, presented to the parties in late December 2000. They provided for Palestine sovereignty over 94 to 96 percent of the West Bank and a land swap of up to 3 percent more. Palestinian refugees would have the right to return to the West Bank and Gaza, and some might be absorbed into Israel, at Israel\u2019s discretion. In Jerusalem, Palestinians would have sovereignty over the Arab neighborhoods and over the Temple Mount. According to Robert Malley from the U.S. negotiating team and Hussein Agha, the Palestinian adviser, \u201cThe president\u2019s proposal showed that the distance traveled since Camp David was indeed considerable, and almost all in the Palestinians\u2019 direction.\u201d\n\nBarak largely accepted the parameters, but Arafat did not, and the clock ran out on Clinton\u2019s presidency. Why did this proposal fail as well?\n\nNow the Americans are coming up with ideas, and the Palestinian side is not in a mood to trust the administration or show the kind of willingness Barak was going to show. So the Palestinians delayed their response, and then they told Clinton they had several reservations.\n\nThe violence of the Second Intifada and onward isn\u2019t only because of the triggers like Sharon visiting the Al Aqsa Mosque on the Temple Mount. It\u2019s also because of the foundational deprivation of freedom and equality. We destine ourselves to be in a constant state of conflict. There was a period during Oslo when I think a bigger part of our population did understand. But then out of a mix of reasons that included legitimate fear about security, we didn\u2019t take it seriously enough.\n\nPart 5: Lessons of Oslo\n\nThe home of Yarden Romann, suspected to have been kidnapped by Hamas and taken to Gaza, October 2023.

Ahmad Hasaballah Bombing inside the northern part of the Gaza Strip, Nov. 6, 2023. Ziv Koren/Polaris\n\nWhen Oslo began, and the Israeli and Palestinian teams decided not to talk about the past, they imagined setting aside their competing narratives \u2014 especially the origin stories of 1948 \u2014 to focus on practical questions about the present, about how to live alongside one another. Perhaps setting aside the past is impossible, however, when one people\u2019s realization of its aspirations, and its sense of survival, mean the other people\u2019s loss of roots and place.\n\nBazelon: Does finding a way forward begin with reckoning with the past?\n\nShikaki: There is really no way in which one can end the conflict if one is not to resolve \u201948. In theory, one can reach a peace agreement without addressing \u201948, and I think that some Palestinians might have agreed to that \u2014 that is, leaving the issues of \u201948 for a later stage, including the right of return \u2014 if doing so is not the end to the conflict, and the parties can raise further claims in the future. But I think there might be greater resistance to that from the Israelis. And therefore, I do think that \u201948 must be part and parcel if our goal is to permanently end the conflict.\n\nKurtzer: I am mindful as a former diplomat to avoid blunt language. But if Palestinians expect that anybody will accept reverting to 1948, they\u2019re going to be sorely disappointed. And if Israelis believe that they can achieve an agreement on something less than 1967, they\u2019re going to be sorely disappointed.\n\nThe only outcome that may work, but I don\u2019t see it happening in the immediate future, is \u201967. Meaning a Palestinian state that effectively covers 100 percent of 22 percent of Palestine, with some land swaps. East Jerusalem is going to be in that package. A creative solution to the Old City will be in that package. The United States is not under any foreseeable presidency going to deliver anything else.\n\nShikaki: I think the most important failure of the past has been the fact that the process was always open-ended, without a two-state solution as the goal. And that is certainly something that any new negotiations must not repeat.\n\nYehuda: Yes, we need a long transition, but there needs to be an end game. It\u2019s not easy to build a functioning state. The transition period needs to be focused on building a viable, sustainable, successful Palestinian state. It also must be focused on security for Israelis. That has always been necessary, but now, after Oct. 7, it is even more so.\n\nBazelon: The Hamas attacks on Oct. 7 have made peace seem more elusive than ever. Hamas invaded Israel to commit terrible violence and provoked a war in which Israel is inflicting mass civilian casualties in Gaza. Though I know it feels remote now, out of war can come peace. This happened in the 1970s between Israel and Egypt, and later Jordan, and it has happened with some of the world\u2019s other most intractable conflicts, like Ireland and Bosnia. Could it happen again?\n\nMargalit: Remembering Rabin\u2019s worry when some Israelis evacuated from Tel Aviv in 1991 because of the Iraqi Scuds, I think it\u2019s crucial to understand what is abetting the Gaza war now, from the Israeli point of view, namely evacuating and destroying a whole suite of land, within southern Israel, with towns and kibbutzim, and also people leaving the north because of airstrikes from Hezbollah in Lebanon. The evacuation of all these people is a crucial moment in Israeli history. Making a deserted strip of land in the north and south is in a way dismembering or dismantling not just the territorial integrity of Israel but really the whole Labor Zionist vision. Because this is all within the green line.\n\nUnder what conditions will people be willing to go back to these places? That will be the endpoint of the war, I think.\n\nI\u2019ve thought that only a catastrophe can bring about a solution. I think this moment has the potential to be this kind of catastrophe. Not only because of the momentous events both in Gaza and in Israel but also because it\u2019s the first time, in this war, that Israel depends on a United States military presence in the Mediterranean Sea in a big way to deter Hezbollah and Iran. This is a real change, a dramatic change in terms of the dependence of Israel on the United States. It\u2019s time for the United States to pursue a version of what Dan said, which to me is sheer common sense.\n\nInbar: I was lecturing on the conflict in Athens at a think tank, and somebody told me: Listen, you fight for so long. Enough is enough. So I asked him, How many years did you fight the Turks? And I believe his answer was about 250 years. And I thought, you know, if this is the frame of reference, then we have a young conflict.\n\nIt\u2019s an ethno-national conflict, and we see that both sides have tremendous energy. Both sides are ready to fight to spill their own blood. It\u2019s very important to get tired. Without getting tired of the conflict, we\u2019ll continue to fight each other. And I do not believe an imposed solution will be useful.\n\nOn how the Hamas attack of Oct. 7 and the war in Gaza will influence the conflict, I disagree with Avishai and Limor. Because for Israel, this is a war to restore deterrence. Israel has to show deterrence in order to survive in the Middle East. In the Middle East if you are not strong, you invite aggression. I think this is true of how Middle Easterners, in various capitals, view interstate relations in this region.\n\nEl Kurd: For any kind of future agreement, if there is to be one, there has to be clarity that the Palestinian public does not just want self-governance. Palestinians want self-determination, and they want sovereignty.\n\nDajani: I think that really did disappear from view during Oslo. And at this juncture we are talking about parity. There are roughly seven million Palestinians and seven million Jews living between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. And so what we have to figure out is how we live together in this space. There\u2019s really not an alternative.\n\nAt present, the frame for how we live together is that some five million people in that space just don\u2019t have political rights and also have deeply constrained civil rights and very limited access to social and economic rights, including health. That is an unsustainable frame.\n\nI realize from Oslo and Camp David how incredibly difficult it is for international actors to intervene constructively to design a mission that could work, but in view of how far apart these parties are, I can\u2019t imagine how we make any progress without such a step.\n\nMargalit: There is a sense that if you think that you have a solution, it means that you don\u2019t understand the problem and you are na\u00efve.\n\nBut then there is the biblical question: Shall the sword devour forever? And I think that the answer should be no. I don\u2019t think that we must wait for 250 years.\n\nThe Panelists:\n\nOmar Dajani is a professor at the McGeorge School of Law at the University of the Pacific.
