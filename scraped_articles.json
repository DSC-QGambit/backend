          "title": "FDA Approves Pfizer\u2019s Coronavirus Vaccine",
          "text": "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday night approved the first coronavirus vaccine for emergency use in the United States, several media outlets reported, clearing the way for U.S. officials to begin vaccinating millions of Americans as early as next week.\n\nThe New York Times wrote:\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration authorized Pfizer\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use on Friday, according to three people with knowledge of the decision who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it. The action means millions of highly vulnerable people will begin receiving the vaccine within days.\n\nThe Washington Post also confirmed the news that the FDA has approved the vaccine. The Post wrote:\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration on Friday gave emergency use authorization to the nation\u2019s first coronavirus vaccine, launching what scientists hope will be a critical counteroffensive against a pathogen that has killed more than 290,000 Americans, shredded the nation\u2019s social and political fabric and devastated the economy.\n\nThe vaccine, from Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, will reportedly be shipped out in the. millions across America over the next week. The United States joins other countries, including the United Kingdom and Canada, in approving the vaccine. The Pfizer vaccine is administered in two separate doses ,weeks apart, and American officials have been preparing, as the vaccine requires being frozen for a massive undertaking of shipping and storing the vaccine nationwide. Pfizer has said the vaccine has a 95 percent effectiveness rate, without any serious side effects.\n\nThis week, U.S. officials from President Donald Trump\u2019s administration gathered with governors at the White House to tout the coming vaccine and lay out a vision for distributing it nationwide.\n\nTrump released a video on Twitter announcing the news of the FDA\u2019s approval of the vaccine, saying it met the \u201cgold standard of safety\u201d of the world\u2019s premiere agency that gauges effectiveness and safety of medicines.\n\n\u201cI have really good news,\u201d Trump said. \u201cToday our nation has achieved a medical miracle. We have delivered a safe and effective vaccine in just nine months. This is one of the greatest scientific accomplishments in history. It will save millions of lives and end the pandemic once and for all.\u201d\n\nTrump also touted Operation Warp Speed as helping deliver this vaccine, as his administration through this program put huge funding behind the effort to develop the cure\u2014and to get it distributed out to the general public. The president said that while governors will decide how the vaccine is administered in their states, \u201cthe first vaccine will be administered in less than 24 hours.\u201d\n\nHe also said that all Americans will be able to get it for free.\n\n\u201cWe have made sure that this vaccine will be free for all Americans,\u201d Trump said.\n\nSenior officials from the Trump administration celebrated the news too.\n\n\u201cIt is nothing short of a medical miracle to have FDA authorization of a vaccine for COVID-19 just over 11 months since the virus was made known to the world,\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement. \u201cBecause of President Trump\u2019s strong leadership and unwavering support for Operation Warp Speed, we have millions of doses of this vaccine that are now being shipped to every corner of America, with administration to begin as soon as providers are ready. The triumph of Operation Warp Speed is a tribute to dedicated public servants across HHS and the Department of Defense, our partners in the private sector, and incredible American scientists. This vaccine, like any vaccine FDA potentially authorizes, has been through multiple stages of safety review, and it has shown extraordinary effectiveness in protecting people from the virus. Vaccines will help bring this pandemic to an end, which is all the more reason to double down on the public health measures we need to stay safe in the coming months. As Americans get vaccinated, we need to continue taking steps like washing our hands, social distancing, and wearing face coverings to protect ourselves, our loved ones, and our communities.\u201d\n\nActing Defense Secretary Christopher Miller, whose Department is overseeing the logistics side of vaccine distribution through Operation Warp Speed, praised servicemen and women who are leading the effort to get the vaccine out all across America.\n\n\u201cThe massive logistical planning our military has contributed to Operation Warp Speed gives me even more pride in the talent and dedication of our service members,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThey have been crucial in bringing a safe and effective vaccine to the American people and in restoring the health of our country.\u201d\n\nVaccines normally take years to develop and receive approval, but Trump\u2019s Operation Warp Speed\u2013part of the White House Coronavirus Task Force effort under the president\u2019s leadership\u2013sped up the process significantl, having one ready in less than a year since the novel coronavirus pandemic first broke out across the United States and around the world.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Breitbart News in April, FDA commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn estimated that the vaccine may take as long as a year to 18 months from then to develop and approve\u2013so this nine-month timetable is truly record-setting.\n\n\u201cOn vaccine development, as you know it takes time for vaccines,\u201d Hahn said in early April. \u201cIn record time, a company in collaboration with the FDA and U.S. government\u2014and N.I.H. was involved with this too\u2014a company has gotten a vaccine into clinical trials. That\u2019s a safety clinical trial, so the earliest\u2014we\u2019re working with a number of manufacturers, so PHARMA and vaccine manufacturers have stood up and really leaned in on this one. We are working with a number of manufacturers, and there are a number of promising candidates. We\u2019re working hard to accelerate that timetable. Typically it takes years. Dr. Fauci has mentioned on TV that it may take 12 to 18 months. I think that is a typical and reasonable timeframe. But I don\u2019t want the American people to think we\u2019re resting on a standard timetable here. We\u2019re really pushing hard to try to accelerate things here. There\u2019s a number of things we can do from a regulatory point of view and with respect to manufacturing capacity to help the clinical trials get performed so they\u2019re as efficient as possible\u2014and also around sharing of data. This is where industry where again, normally as competitors, they have committed to sharing so we can have the absolute best products in the hands of the American people and that includes vaccines.\u201d\n\nBut this process was not without its hiccups. Other countries had approved the vaccine first, before the FDA here in the United States, and the FDA\u2019s advisory committee had recommended its approval earlier this week. Several media outlets reported that White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows leaned in on Hahn Friday to ensure the FDA got final emergency approval across the finish line this week\u2013 or else he\u2019d be fired\u2013 reportedly that some at FDA pushed back on. Hahn himself said that the media reports of such a phone call were inaccurate.\n\nThe virus, which intelligence officials agree emanated from Wuhan, China, has completely upended the world and the United States for the past nine months. The FDA approval of the Pfizer vaccine, and looming potential approvals of other vaccine candidates, gives hope to an otherwise grim pandemic that has shaken the world. It also completely changed the trajectory of the 2020 presidential campaign, as Democrat candidate former Vice President Joe Biden made Trump\u2019s response to the pandemic a centerpiece of his campaign. While Trump continues to challenge the election results, Biden is currently the certified winner in well more than enough states to easily secure an electoral college victory. Next week, those electors will, barring any last-second surprises, formally be slated for Biden\u2013all while the coronavirus vaccine is administered to the first of what is expected to be millions of Americans who eventually get it\u2013capping a tumultuous year in American politics, health, and science.",

          "title": "The Supreme Court's clear message to President Trump: Stop",
          "text": "(CNN) During the past four years, President Donald Trump has challenged the integrity of the Supreme Court and tried to drag the justices into the legal muck with him.\n\nHis arguments have pushed the boundaries of the law and his assertions have tested the impartiality of individual justices. But Trump's meritless attack on the November election and his loss to Joe Biden in a brazen lawsuit initiated by the Texas attorney general brought the court into a wholly new realm.\n\nThe high court slapped down the case promoted by Trump on Friday, three days before the Electoral College will meet to cast votes for Biden as the winner of the November election, with no noted dissents.\n\nAs such, the court's justices, six of whom were appointed by Republican presidents, three by Trump, have separated themselves from the pattern of hard-core partisans who were asking the court to use baseless claims of widespread voter fraud to disenfranchise millions of voters.\n\nIf the justices had not rejected the request from Texas and other Republican-led states, they would have defied their own precedent and compromised any notion of neutrality.\n\nFor the Supreme Court itself, there has always been a question of how it emerges from Trump's legally fraught four years. Many of his policy initiatives -- and some of his personal financial dealings -- were subject to lawsuits.\n\nAnd the President routinely suggested that once a case reached the conservative-dominated bench, he would prevail. His Twitter posts and other rhetoric have constantly undermined the notion of neutral judges. He implied Democratic appointees would automatically rule against him and Republican appointees would side with him.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, a few hours before the justices' order in Texas v. Pennsylvania, Trump tweeted, \"If the Supreme Court shows Great Wisdom and Courage, the American People will win perhaps the most important case in history and our Electoral Process will be respected again!\"\n\nHe had pushed for swift Senate confirmation in October of his third appointee, Amy Coney Barrett, to succeed the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg, saying the court might end up deciding the election. (Barrett did not recuse herself from the Texas case.)\n\nBefore Trump brought the country to this point on the election, his policy agenda had bitterly divided the nine justices, such as on the travel ban that affected majority-Muslim countries and his attempt to end the \"Dreamers\" program for young immigrants who came to the US without proper papers.\n\nTrump prevailed on the first, in 2018, and lost on the second, just this year. The administration generally did better in the early years, as the court majority soon grew frustrated with the Trump team's failure to comply with procedural norms.\n\nIn opinions written by Chief Justice John Roberts, the court found that the administration contrived a rationale for a proposed citizenship question on the 2020 census and, separately, failed to justify its rollback of protections for \"Dreamers\" in the Obama-sponsored Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals , or DACA, program.\n\nBut Trump could usually count on two or more justices on the right-wing to endorse his positions.\n\nIn the election case, not a single justice expressed any openness to the Texas and Trump assertions of election irregularities. Friday night's order was unsigned.\n\nThe only other comment in the court's action may be mainly of interest to the legal community, rather than relevant to the election results. In asking the justices to exercise its \"original jurisdiction, Paxton tried to vault over lower courts and brush aside rulings against the President and his allies. Only Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas wrote a separate statement saying they would have given Texas permission to file the case. But they also said they would not have granted any claims.\n\nThe substance of the case aside, the sloppiness of some of filings might have generated additional frustrations for the justices. The apparent haste in which many were put together reinforced the overall weakness of the arguments. A brief from GOP states that included Louisiana spelled it \"Lousiana.\" The filing from GOP lawmakers placed Republican Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey from South Carolina instead. Advocates for the \"New California\" and \"New Nevada\" states, siding with Texas, repeatedly misspelled the name of current California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nJUST WATCHED Dale: I don't usually have to fact-check court briefs Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Dale: I don't usually have to fact-check court briefs 03:35\n\nTrump vs. The Roberts Court\n\nOver his tenure, Trump has split the high court and put Roberts on the defensive.\n\nAfter Trump derided a judge who ruled against him in November 2018 as an \"Obama judge,\" Roberts issued a statement: \"We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\"\n\nThe Roberts Court majority has sided with the President's positions more often than not, particularly on pro-corporate, anti-immigrant, and conservative religious liberty claims. But there have been recent high-profile losses, including the DACA case this year, that have drawn Trump's wrath on Twitter.\n\nThe administration may be headed for another. Based on the justices' comments during arguments over the Affordable Care Act in November, Trump may soon lose his attempt to kill Obamacare. During arguments, Roberts expressed frustration that opponents of the law that has brought health insurance coverage to 20 million more Americans had failed to end it legislatively and were asking the judicial branch to do it for them.\n\nIrrespective of whether the justices ruled for the administration or its challengers, Roberts took pains to signal the justices' independence.\n\n\"We should celebrate our strong and independent judiciary, a key source of national unity and stability,\" Roberts wrote in his 2019 year-end message. \"But we should also remember that justice is not inevitable.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Famed GOP election lawyer weighs in on Supreme Court decision Replay More Videos ...

          "title": "Trump's effort to overthrow democracy dead ends at Supreme Court but the damage is lasting",
          "text": "(CNN) President Donald Trump's effort to unravel democracy hit a dead end at the Supreme Court Friday night, capping five weeks in which he dragged the country along on his narcissistic quest to stay in power after President-elect Joe Biden overwhelmingly won the election.\n\nIn the end, the guardrails of democracy stayed in place. Trump lost -- for the second time at the Supreme Court this week. But instead of helping the effort to curb a deadly pandemic that has claimed nearly 300,000 American lives by easing the transition for his successor, he is already scheming about his next political moves. Before the high court rejected his bid Friday, his campaign announced a cable ad buy to further his fraudulent claims about the election, and he clearly intends to try and meddle in Congress' counting of the Electoral College results in January.\n\nMore broadly, the damage he has done to Americans' faith and trust in democratic institutions will last long after he packs his bags and ends what will go down as one of the worst presidencies in history.\n\nWhile waiting to hear from the Supreme Court on Friday, Trump attacked another American institution, opening a new front in his war on science and ethics by pressuring the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration to rush the process for granting emergency use authorization for Pfizer and BioNTech's coronavirus vaccine. Ultimately, the FDA greenlighted the vaccine late Friday night in the time frame that was expected.\n\nIt was fitting that on a historic day -- when Americans got their first confirmation that vaccines could soon be on the way -- the President was distracted at the White House, stewing over his election defeats and tweeting lies about voting in Georgia.\n\nTrump \"put a huge stress test on our democracy,\" GOP election lawyer Ben Ginsberg said, reflecting on the destruction that the commander-in-chief has wrought by undermining US election processes and jeopardizing the safety of countless election workers as he pursued frivolous lawsuits that were scorned even by judges he appointed.\n\n\"It's five weeks after Election Day, and the institutions of our democracy held against this onslaught, and so we should be really proud of that,\" Ginsberg said to CNN's Wolf Blitzer on \"The Situation Room\" Friday evening. \"At the same time, the Republicans who did follow Donald Trump really have an obligation now to make the country strong again, to heal the chinks that Donald Trump tried to put in the foundation and the democracy.\"\n\nBut there are few signs that Trump loyalists are taking that moment of reflection in a deeply fractured Republican Party. When Trump joined Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's lawsuit, which was also joined by 19 GOP attorneys general and was attempting to invalidate the votes of millions of voters in Biden-won states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia and Wisconsin, more than 125 GOP House lawmakers also signed on, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nThey knew that the lawsuit would serve as a loyalty litmus test as Trump openly contemplates another run for the White House in 2024, and it was a frightening sign of the GOP's acquiescence to the President's dictatorial machinations and acceptance of his wild conspiracy theories.\n\n\"The Supreme Court really let us down. No wisdom, No Courage!\" Trump tweeted shortly before midnight.\n\nBut the Supreme Court's order once again affirmed that the President's legal efforts have been a total waste of time for the country at a moment when there were lives to be saved.\n\nDespite the court's solid conservative majority -- and the fact that Trump named three of the justices seated on the court -- there were no noted dissents to the court's order, which essentially said that Texas has no grounds to challenge how other states conduct their elections.\n\nJustices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas said in a statement that they would have allowed Texas to file the case on procedural grounds, but would not have granted any other relief -- making it clear that they, too, rejected the substance of Texas' arguments.\n\n\"Every American who cares about the rule of law should take comfort that the Supreme Court \u2014 including all three of President Trump's picks \u2014 closed the book on the nonsense,\" Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse -- a rare Trump critic in the GOP -- said in a statement Friday evening.\n\nStephen Vladeck, a CNN Supreme Court analyst and University of Texas Law professor, said the court's unsigned order was \"the closest possible thing to the last nail in the coffin for election-related legal challenges.\"\n\nEven Trump seemed to explicitly acknowledge earlier in the day that Biden would be the next president in a tweet calling on the Supreme Court to \"show great Courage & Wisdom\" and \"Save the USA!!\" In the same tweet, he alleged that \"the Biden administration will be a scandal-plagued mess for years to come.\" But a White House spokesman said the tweet should not be interpreted as a concession.\n\nBiden's campaign hailed the Supreme Court's decision. \"Dozens of judges, election officials from both parties, and Trump's own Attorney General have dismissed his baseless attempts to deny that he lost the election,\" Mike Gwin, Biden's campaign spokesman said. \"President-elect Biden's clear and commanding victory will be ratified by the Electoral College on Monday, and he will be sworn in on January 20th.\"\n\nTrump tries to subvert science\n\nShortly after the FDA issued emergency use authorization for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the President released a pre-recorded video on Twitter heralding the \"medical miracle\" of the arrival of a \"safe and effective vaccine in just nine months.\"\n\n\"This is one of the greatest scientific achievements in history,\" he said. \"It will save millions of lives and soon end the pandemic once and for all.\"\n\nHe thanked \"all of the brilliant scientists, technicians, doctors and workers who made this all possible,\" and highlighted the safety of the vaccines noting that the clinical trials showed that both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna were 95% effective. Moderna is seeking emergency use authorization from the FDA next week.\n\nThe first doses of the vaccine could be injected as early as Monday or Tuesday if an advisory panel to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, along with that agency, also sign off. The CDC advisory panel has now scheduled an emergency meeting for Saturday to discuss that decision.\n\n\"I promised that we would produce a vaccine in record time before the end of the year,\" Trump said. \"They said it couldn't be done, but with today's announcement, we have now achieved that goal.\"\n\nHe called the vaccine \"verifiably safe and effective,\" but hours earlier he smashed through the time-honored tradition in the United States of separating politics from science by trying to interfere in the FDA's authorization process.\n\nFrustrated by the fact that other countries like the United Kingdom began vaccinating their citizens first, the President appeared to lean on the FDA to accelerate their review -- which could increase the skittishness of Americans who are already wary of taking the vaccine because of fears it was rushed. A Gallup poll released this week showed that 63% of Americans now say they are willing to be immunized against Covid-19.\n\nOn Twitter Friday, Trump called the FDA \"a big, old, slow turtle.\"\n\n\"Get the dam vaccines out NOW, Dr. Hahn @SteveFDA,\" Trump tweeted at Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn, misspelling the word \"damn.\" \"Stop playing games and start saving lives!!!\"\n\nAt the time of his pressure campaign, sources told CNN the FDA had been expected to grant emergency use authorization either Friday or Saturday, so it was unclear why Trump felt the need to weigh in on a decision that would come within hours.\n\non Friday morning that he needed to grant an emergency use authorization for Pfizer and BioNTech's coronavirus vaccine by the end of the day or he should resign. CNN's White House team reported that White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told Hahn during a callon Friday morning that he needed to grant an emergency use authorization for Pfizer and BioNTech's coronavirus vaccine by the end of the day or he should resign.\n\nHahn called reports of the conversation, which first appeared in The Washington Post, \"an untrue representation\" and said the FDA was \"encouraged to continue working expeditiously.\"\n\nBut even Dr. Moncef Slaoui, the head of Operation Warp Speed -- the Trump administration's effort to develop and distribute vaccines against Covid-19 -- said the appearance of pressure could harm the nearly year-long efforts by top scientists and medical experts to assuage concerns about the vaccine.\n\n-- if the story is right,\" he told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"The Lead.\" Earlier this year, Slaoui told \"I think there is an opportunity there for people to see undue pressure- if the story is right,\" he told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"The Lead.\" Earlier this year, Slaoui told Science Magazine that he \"would immediately resign\" from his role with Operation Warp Speed \"if there is undue interference in this process.\"\n\nSlaoui, an immunologist who previously headed vaccine development at GlaxoSmithKline, said that the FDA has conducted \"an effective, transparent, thorough, in-depth review\" of the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine and asked Americans to \"keep an open mind\" and an eye on the transparency of the process.\n\n\"We have to go out there and engage with all of the leadership at all levels in our communities to help explain the features with of the vaccine, its performance, and hopefully engage with people and convince them\" to take it, Slaoui said.",

          "text": "(CNN) Trucks and planes loaded with Pfizer and BioNTech's vaccine will soon be departing from Kalamazoo, Michigan, to hospitals around the country, following the Food and Drug Administration's emergency use authorization (EUA).\n\n\"We need to take a moment, I think, and just consider that we are having this mass casualty event every day here in the US, but now we have this vaccine developed in record time that can in time really save us and save our country and save the world from this awful pandemic,\" emergency physician Dr. Leana Wen told CNN's Chris Cuomo moments after the authorization.\n\n\"This is really a monumental moment for us,\" she added.\n\nThe news comes during the most difficult weeks the US has faced since the pandemic's start. Friday saw the highest number of new cases, hospitalizations and daily deaths since the pandemic's start. More than 3,300 American deaths were reported.\n\nFDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn called the EUA a \"significant milestone\" in battling the pandemic, that comes after an \"open and transparent review process that included input from independent scientific and public health experts and a thorough evaluation by the agency's career scientists.\"\n\nThere are just two key steps left before vaccinations can start: a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory committee -- scheduled to meet Saturday morning -- must vote to recommend the vaccine and the agency must then accept that recommendation.\n\nThen, vaccinations can begin. But it'll be months before most Americans will get a vaccine.\n\nLast week, vaccine advisers to the CDC voted to recommend that both health care workers and long-term care facility residents be first in line for Covid-19 vaccines that get the green light from the FDA. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar has said about 20 million Americans should be vaccinated by the end of the month, 50 million by the end of January and at least 100 million people should be vaccinated by the end of the first quarter.\n\nOfficials \"remain confident,\" he added, that there will be enough doses for any American who wants to get vaccinated by summertime.\n\nIn the meantime, the US -- already ravaged by a rampant spread of the virus -- is projected to face brutal days ahead.\n\nOverburdened hospitals across the US\n\nThe country reported more than 231,700 new Covid-19 infections Friday -- the most ever.\n\nSome communities have already begun feeling the impacts of Thanksgiving gatherings and travel -- which officials predicted would lead to even more infections and drive another surge. And that surge could be followed by another surge tied to the upcoming Christmas holiday, some officials have said.\n\nFor at least the sixth day in a row, the US also reported another record high number of hospitalizations: more than 108,000 Covid-19 patients nationwide, according to the COVID Tracking Project.\n\nHospitals in nearly every corner of the country have felt the impact. HHS data shows more than 85% of hospitals nationwide had more Covid-19 patients last week than they did a month ago and overall, about one in five hospital inpatients were confirmed to have Covid-19 last week -- nearly double from a month earlier.\n\nIn the country's 10 largest cities, the share of hospital patients who had the virus ranged from about 9% in New York to 23% in Chicago. Meanwhile in El Paso, Texas, more than 50% of patients in city hospitals had Covid-19 between November 27 and December 3. That's nearly double the national average for that period.\n\nIn Mississippi, the state's top health official said Friday ICUs are full and \"many hospitalizations (are) on the way.\" Elective surgeries requiring hospitalization must be delayed starting Tuesday, State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs said on Twitter.\n\n\"Pressure on ICUs worse than summer surge. 26 hospitals on diversion for critically ill patients,\" Dobbs wrote a day earlier.\n\n'Unprecedented and catastrophic suffering'\n\nThe rise in hospitalized Covid-19 patients nationwide has been followed by climbing death tolls. More than 3,300 American deaths were reported Friday, marking the deadliest day since the pandemic's start. The country's previous record was set Wednesday, with more than 3,100 deaths.\n\nThe next three months will be \"really rough,\" CDC's director warned, even with a vaccine becoming available soon.\n\n\"For the next 60 to 90 days, we're going to have more deaths per day than we had in 9/11,\" Dr. Robert Redfield said Thursday. \"This is going to be a real unfortunate loss of life, as all that we've had so far.\"\n\nAnd it's a reality that a vaccine authorization won't impact, he added.\n\nIn California, Los Angeles County Public Health Director Dr. Barbara Ferrer gave a grim warning about the coming weeks, after announcing the county has doubled its number of new cases in about 10 days.\n\n\"The issue right now is what we call the Thanksgiving surge,\" Ferrer said. \"We had a surge, and now we have a surge on top of a surge, and it's really hard for us to calculate exactly what we're going to see in the next week or two.\"\n\nThe county, she said, is in \"uncharted territory,\" with case numbers and hospitalizations that \"we have not experienced and frankly did not anticipate.\"\n\n\"We're on a very dangerous track to see unprecedented and catastrophic suffering and death here in L.A. County if we can't stop the surge,\" Ferrer said.\n\nFAA urges all airports to be ready for vaccine flights\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration has urged airports nationwide to be ready for flights carrying the Covid-19 vaccine even if the airport is not scheduled to receive it.\n\nOn Thursday, the agency told CNN it would direct air traffic controllers to give priority clearance to flights carrying the vaccine.\n\nStates will receive shipments of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine once a week to begin with after the shots are rolled out, Operation Warp Speed Chief Adviser Moncef Slaoui said Friday.\n\n\"The plan is to ship vaccines once a week and to inform the governors a week in advance about the number of doses they will be receiving,\" Slaoui told CNN. \"Those vaccines ... are meant to be used in full in the population during that period of a week because the same states will receive an identical number of doses in the case of Pfizer's vaccine three weeks later to give as a second dose to give to the recipients of the first dose earlier,\" he said.\n\nThe number of vaccines will increase \"week on week,\" he added, as manufacturing ramps up.\n\nAnd if the Moderna vaccine is authorized, he said, \"that would be quite a significant boost of vaccine to be distributed.\" Vaccine advisers to the FDA will meet next week to discuss an EUA for Moderna's vaccine.",

The Georgia runoff elections give voters a chance to provide that check.\n\nThe stark contrast between the Republican and Democratic visions for America can be seen clearly in these two Senate races. Schumer\u2019s would-be allies in the Senate are Jon Ossoff, a 33-year-old trust-fund socialist from Atlanta and Rev. Raphael Warnock, who has a long record of insulting the police and embracing far-left fashions.\n\nThe Democrats and their allies in the media are trying to present Ossoff and Warnock as moderates, but their records prove this is a lie. Both candidates recently were endorsed by Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, the highest-profile socialist in American politics\u2014and Ossoff actually welcomed his support.\n\nThis approach may win Ossoff friends in the new, radical Democratic Party, but it\u2019s far to the left of most Americans, including most Georgians.\n\nNot to be outdone by Ossoff, Warnock has a history of writing and speaking about his appreciation for Karl Marx and the \u201ccomplex\u201d legacy of Fidel Castro, the communist dictator of Cuba.\n\nAt their debate last Sunday, Loeffler pressed Warnock to clarify his positions and denounce Marxism. That should\u2019ve been a layup for any politician, but Warnock refused to do it.\n\nHow hard is it to denounce Karl Marx\u2019s radical ideology, which has been responsible for the impoverishment and death of more than 100 million people?\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIf Ossoff and Warnock are comfortable defending socialism in the middle of a heated election, imagine what they\u2019ll do if they\u2019re in power. Both politicians will be reliable votes for Schumer\u2019s priorities in the Senate\u2014and they could soon crown him as Majority Leader.\n\nThe Democrats are hoping voters won\u2019t think about the runoff elections in those stark terms. But that\u2019s the truth Georgia voters must keep in mind as they head to the polls.\n\nRepublican Ken Buck represents Colorado in the United States House of Representatives.",

          "text": "The leader of the Republican Party in Texas suggested Friday that \u201claw-abiding states\u201d might want to form their own \"union,\" after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the Lone Star State\u2019s lawsuit over the 2020 presidential election, according to reports.\n\nThe high court\u2019s decision was the latest legal setback in GOP efforts to overturn Nov. 3 results that gave Democrat Joe Biden a victory over President Trump, denying Trump a second four-year term.\n\nTexas asserted it had a right \u201cto demand that all other States abide by the constitutionally set rules in appointing presidential electors to the electoral college.\u201d It claimed that other states suffered whenever one state \u201cviolates federal law to affect the outcome of a presidential election.\"\n\nBut the court dismissed the case based on that issue, according to The Associated Press. It said that Texas \u201chas not demonstrated a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another State conducts its elections.\u201d\n\nAfter the ruling, Allen West, a former Florida congressman who has headed the Texas GOP since July, issued a response.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court, in tossing the Texas lawsuit that was joined by seventeen states and 106 US congressman, [has] decreed that a state can take unconstitutional actions and violate its own election law -- resulting in damaging effects on other states that abide by the law, while the guilty state suffers no consequences,\u201d West wrote, according to KTVT-TV of Dallas-Fort Worth.\n\n\u201cThis decision establishes a precedent that says states can violate the U.S. Constitution and not be held accountable,\u201d West continued. \u201cThis decision will have far-reaching ramifications for the future of our constitutional republic.\n\n'TEXIT' TEST: TEXAS LAWMAKER FLOATS REFERENDUM TO SECEDE FROM US\n\n\u201cPerhaps law-abiding states should bond together and form a Union of states that will abide by the Constitution,\u201d he added.\n\n'Out of control'\n\nWest\u2019s proposal echoed a similar sentiment expressed earlier in the week by Texas state Rep. Kyle Biedermann, R-Fredericksburg, who called for a referendum that would allow voters to decide if Texas should break off from the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe federal government is out of control and does not represent the values of Texans. That is why I am committing to file legislation this session that will allow a referendum to give Texans a vote for the State of Texas to reassert its status as an independent nation,\u201d Biedermann said in a statement.\n\nRush's judgment\n\nIn addition, radio host Rush Limbaugh this week also stated that perhaps a fissure in the U.S. was inevitable, given the chronic disagreements between conservatives and liberals.\n\n\u201cI actually think \u2014 and I\u2019ve referenced this, I\u2019ve alluded to this a couple of times because I\u2019ve seen others allude to this \u2014 I actually think that we\u2019re trending toward secession,\u201d Limbaugh said on his show Wednesday, according to MediaMatters.org.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t go on this way,\" he continued. \"There cannot be a peaceful coexistence of two completely different theories of life, theories of government, theories of how we manage our affairs. We can\u2019t be in this dire a conflict without something giving somewhere along the way.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Trump administration, meanwhile, didn\u2019t appear ready to give up its fight to have its claims of voter fraud recognized in a court of law.\n\nDuring a Friday appearance on \u201cHannity,\u201d Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani said the president's legal team isn't done with its elections challenges.\n\n\"The people of this country are entitled to a hearing on this,\" he said. \"They should have at least given us a hearing so that we can present our facts and not just pushed it off to the side so no one would ever get to hear these facts.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this story.",

But around 8:30 p.m., guests were informed that Mr. Trump would not be coming down from the residence to speak.\n\nMr. Trump weighed in later on Twitter. \u201cThe Supreme Court really let us down,\u201d he said. \u201cNo Wisdom, No Courage!\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s order was not quite unanimous. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, issued a brief statement on a technical point. But it was nonetheless a comprehensive rebuke to Mr. Trump and his allies. It was plain that the justices had no patience for Texas\u2019 attempt to enlist the court in an effort to tell other states how to run their elections.\n\nThe majority ruled that Texas could not file its lawsuit at all. \u201cThe state of Texas\u2019 motion for leave to file a bill of complaint is denied for lack of standing,\u201d the court\u2019s order said.\n\nJustice Alito, taking a slightly different approach, wrote that the court was not free immediately to shut down lawsuits filed by states directly in the court. \u201cIn my view,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwe do not have discretion to deny the filing of a bill of complaint in a case that falls within our original jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nBut that was as far as those two justices were willing to go. \u201cI would therefore grant the motion to file the bill of complaint but would not grant other relief,\u201d Justice Alito wrote, \u201cand I express no view on any other issue.\u201d\n\nSome of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers had anticipated the court would give the president and the Republican attorneys general something that could be characterized as supportive, in the form of a dissent or a lengthy commentary.

Biden Jr. on Monday, leaves the president\u2019s party in an extraordinary position. Through their explicit endorsements or complicity of silence, much of the G.O.P. leadership now shares responsibility for the quixotic attempt to ignore the nation\u2019s founding principles and engineer a different verdict from the one voters cast on Election Day.\n\nMany regular Republicans supported this effort, too \u2014 a sign that Mr. Trump has not just bent the party to his will, but pressed a mainstay of American politics for nearly two centuries into the service of overturning an election outcome and assaulting public faith in the electoral system. The G.O.P. sought to undo the vote by such spurious means that the conservative majority on the Supreme Court quickly rejected the argument.\n\nEven some Republican leaders delivered a withering assessment of the 126 G.O.P.

That would be enough to inoculate 20 million people.\n\nRural areas where hospitals are not equipped to keep the vaccines at the right temperatures, or do not have the staff to prepare them for injection, will not receive the Pfizer shots.

It also exposed a younger generation to the battlefield sacrifices and the shocking failures of leadership that led to the surprise concerted Arab attack on Yom Kippur, led by the Egyptian and Syrian armies. The period is so painful that Israeli culture has rarely dared to grapple with it.\n\n\u201cThis was our worst trauma and our worst disaster as a country,\u201d said Ron Leshem, who cocreated the series together with Amit Cohen, both veterans of the Israeli military\u2019s elite 8200 intelligence unit. \u201cFor 47 years, people had the feeling this was a forgotten war and that they would end their lives without anyone knowing their stories,\u201d Mr. Leshem added. \u201cWe knew we had an awful responsibility.\u201d\n\nThe series, aired by the Israeli public broadcaster Kan, was 10 years in the making with a multimillion-dollar budget far exceeding those of typical Israeli productions. It featured heart-stopping recreations of epic tank battles in their original locations in the Golan Heights, which Israel had seized from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.

          "title": "Supreme court rejects Trump-backed Texas lawsuit aiming to overturn election results",
          "text": "The US supreme court has unanimously rejected a baseless lawsuit filed by Texas seeking to overturn the presidential election result, dealing the biggest blow yet to Donald Trump\u2019s assault on democracy.\n\nIn a brief, one page order, all nine justices on America\u2019s highest court dismissed the longshot effort to throw out the vote counts in four states that the president lost: Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nThe decision hammers another nail in the coffin of Trump\u2019s increasingly desperate effort to subvert the will of the people and deny Joe Biden the presidency.\n\nThe suit filed by Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, sought to invalidate the results in four swing states, asking the court to extend the deadline for election certification so alleged voting irregularities could be investigated.\n\nIt was backed by Donald Trump, 17 other states and 126 Republicans in the House of Representatives \u2013 more than half the caucus \u2013 including the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy of California, and the minority whip, Steve Scalise of Louisiana.\n\nTrump had long expressed hope that a disputed election would go before the supreme court, to which he appointed three justices during his term, ensuring a 6-3 conservative majority. Earlier on Friday he tweeted: \u201cIf the Supreme Court shows great Wisdom and Courage, the American People will win perhaps the most important case in history, and our Electoral Process will be respected again!\u201d\n\nBut hours later, his hopes of a political miracle were all but extinguished. The supreme court wrote: \u201cThe State of Texas\u2019s motion for leave to file a bill of complaint is denied for lack of standing under Article III of the Constitution. Texas has not demonstrated a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another State conducts its elections. All other pending motions are dismissed as moot.\u201d\n\nOfficials in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Wisconsin had derided the suit as a publicity stunt. More than 20 other attorneys general from states including California and Virginia also filed a brief on Thursday urging the court to reject the case.\n\nJosh Shapiro, the attorney general of Pennsylvania, welcomed the court\u2019s ruling. \u201cOur nation\u2019s highest court saw through this seditious abuse of our electoral process,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThis swift denial should make anyone contemplating further attacks on our election think twice.\u201d\n\nThe supreme court has dealt a major blow to Donald Trump\u2019s longshot bid to overturn the election results. Photograph: Patrick Semansky/AP\n\nDemocrats in Congress also expressed gratitude. Eric Swalwell of California tweeted: \u201cThe Supreme Court, a mix of conservative and liberal members, united to defend your vote against @realDonaldTrumpand his democracy deniers in Congress.\u201d\n\nAnd Senator Ben Sasse, one of relatively few Republicans to acknowledge Biden\u2019s victory, signalled that it was time for the party and government to move on. He said: \u201cSince Election Night, a lot of people have been confusing voters by spinning Kenyan Birther-type, \u2018Chavez rigged the election from the grave\u2019 conspiracy theories, but every American who cares about the rule of law should take comfort that the Supreme Court \u2013 including all three of President Trump\u2019s picks \u2013 closed the book on the nonsense.\u201d\n\nCourts have dismissed numerous of lawsuits and appeals by the Trump campaign and its allies in various states. William Barr, the attorney general and a staunch Trump ally, has said the justice department uncovered no evidence of widespread voter fraud that could change the outcome of the election.\n\nSaturday will mark the 20th anniversary of the court resolving the 2000 election in Republican George W Bush\u2019s favour but that was a much closer contest that came down to one state: Florida. Biden gained 306 votes in the electoral college \u2013 the same as Trump in 2016 \u2013 and leads the national popular vote by 7m.\n\nSome Democrats have accused Trump and his Republican backers of sedition. Chris Murphy, a senator for Connecticut, said in a floor speech on Friday: \u201cThose who are pushing to make Donald Trump president for a second term, no matter the outcome of the election, are engaged in a treachery against their nation.\u201d",

          "title": "Coronavirus: minister threatens headteacher over pre-Christmas online lessons",
          "text": "The government is using its emergency powers under the Coronavirus Act to threaten to use legal action against headteachers in England who want to allow their pupils to learn remotely in the run-up to Christmas.\n\nThe Observer understands any schools that were planning to move most of their teaching online during the last week of term, to ensure none of their pupils would have to self-isolate on Christmas Day, are being ordered to remain open.\n\nOne headteacher in Hertfordshire was sent an official letter last week from the schools minister, Nick Gibb, warning him that the government was prepared to deploy its new powers under the act to ensure his secondary school remained open for all pupils until Friday.\n\nThe school, Presdales in Ware, was planning to teach the majority of its pupils remotely for the last week of term, while continuing to provide socially distanced, face-to-face lessons for vulnerable pupils, children who need extra support and any other students who wished to come into school. Only about 25 pupils were expected to come in, so they could all sit 2 metres away from each other in class.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had nearly 50 [positive] cases since September and a significant outbreak in one year group,\u201d said the headteacher, Matthew Warren. \u201cThere is no chance, in the last week of term, that we\u2019re not going to have any cases.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday last week, 170 staff and children \u2013 including half the English department \u2013 were off school, self isolating. Warren said he and and his senior team were now \u201cdreading\u201d having to call parents, particularly of younger pupils, to tell them their child would have to avoid all contact with anybody else on Christmas Day.\n\nWarren had been keen to ensure his pupils did not have to endure this separation during the festive season. \u201cFor mental health, hearts and minds, we felt it wasn\u2019t fair \u2013 and parents supported us overwhelmingly.\u201d\n\nLast Wednesday, the day before the school planned to close, Gibb wrote a letter to Warren, stating he was \u201cminded to direct\u201d the board of trustees to keep the school gates open and had the power to do this under schedule 17 of the Coronavirus Act. Refusal to comply would have allowed the Department for Education to first direct the board of trustees and then seek a court injunction requiring the school to provide face-to-face lessons, according to legal advice Warren received.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t defend that \u2013 it\u2019s not a good use of public funds, which we\u2019re desperate for,\u201d he said.\n\nPaul Whiteman, the general secretary of school leaders\u2019 union NAHT, said the government\u2019s relaxation of social mixing rules over Christmas had put schools and parents between a rock and hard place, accusing ministers of \u201cpretending to be oblivious to the consequences of their decision\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are calling for the government to give schools the flexibility to work with parents and make arrangements that best suit their individual circumstances. Giving schools the flexibility to switch to remote learning for the final few days of term seems an obvious and straightforward solution. The government\u2019s position is creating huge potential for a chaotic and disruptive end to this term.\u201d\n\nThere is regional variation across the UK in the guidance being given to schools. Last week, in Wales, all secondary schools and colleges were told to close their doors and move all lessons online from Monday.\n\nA Department for Education spokesperson said it was a national priority to keep education settings open full time and it was vital that children remained in school until the end of term. \u201cSchools, colleges and early years settings across the country have worked tremendously hard to put protective measures in place that are helping reduce the risk of the virus being transmitted and our regional school commissioner teams continue to support local authorities and school trusts to remain open and help resolve any operational issues.\u201d\n\nThe Observer also understands that the government is considering mass testing of primary school children, following a decision to roll out mass testing of secondary school pupils in London, Kent and Essex last week. The Department for Education said it would not be commenting on this matter: \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been confirmed and therefore is speculation.\u201d",

          "title": "Trump administration puts second man to death in two days",
          "text": "The Trump administration continued its unprecedented series of post-election federal executions Friday by putting to death a Louisiana truck driver who abused and killed his two-year-old daughter.\n\nAlfred Bourgeois, 56, was pronounced dead at 8.21pm eastern time after receiving a lethal injection at the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana.\n\nHis lawyers argued Bourgeois had an IQ that puts him in the intellectually disabled category, saying that should have made him ineligible for the death penalty under federal law. Victor J Abreu said it was \u201cshameful\u201d to execute his client \u201cwithout fair consideration of his intellectual disability\u201d.\n\nBourgeois was the 10th federal death-row inmate put to death since federal executions resumed under Donald Trump in July after a 17-year hiatus. He was the second federal prisoner executed this week, with three more executions planned in January.\n\nBourgeois met with his spiritual adviser on Friday as he sought to come to terms with the possibility of dying, and he was also praying, one of his lawyers, Shawn Nolan told the Associated Press just hours before the execution.\n\n\u201cHe certainly doesn\u2019t want to die \u2013 and it\u2019s harder for him to grasp being killed by the federal government. But he does get it that this is bad.\u201d\n\nThe attorney added: \u201cHe\u2019s praying for redemption.\u201d\n\nBourgeois took up drawing in prison, including doing renditions of members of his legal team. Nolan said he had not been a troublemaker on death row and had a good disciplinary record.\n\nThe last time the number of civilians executed federally reached double digits in a year was under President Grover Cleveland, with 14 in 1896.\n\nThe series of executions under Trump since election day, the first in late November, also marks the first time in more than 130 years that federal executions have occurred during a lame-duck period. Cleveland also was the last president to do that.\n\nOn Thursday, Brandon Bernard was put to death for his part in a 1999 killing of a religious couple from Iowa after he and other teenage members of a gang abducted and robbed Todd and Stacie Bagley in Texas. The death of Bernard, who was 18 at the time of the killings, was a rare execution of a person who was in his teens when his crime was committed.\n\nSeveral high-profile figures, including Kim Kardashian West, appealed to Trump to commute Bernard\u2019s sentence to life in prison, citing, among other things, Bernard\u2019s youth at the time and the remorse he has expressed over years.\n\nIn Bourgeois\u2019 case, the crimes stand out as particularly brutal because they involved his young daughter.\n\nAccording to court filings, he gained temporary custody of the child after a 2002 paternity suit from a Texas woman. Bourgeois was living in Louisiana with his wife and their two children.\n\nOver the next month, Bourgeois whipped the girl with an electrical cord, burned her feet with a cigarette lighter and hit her in the head with a plastic baseball bat so hard that her head swelled \u2013 then refused to seek medical treatment for her, court documents say. Prosecutors also said he sexually abused her.\n\nIt was during a trucking run to Corpus Christi, Texas, that he ended up killing the toddler, slamming her head on the windows and dashboard four times, court filings say. She died the next day in a hospital of brain injuries.\n\nAfter his 2004 conviction, a judge rejected claims stemming from his alleged intellectual disability, noting he did not receive a diagnosis until after he was sentenced to death.\n\nAttorneys argued that finding was based on misunderstandings about such disabilities. They said Bourgeois had tests that demonstrated his IQ was around 70, well below average, and that his childhood history buttressed their claims.\n\nBourgeois\u2019 lawyers did not argue that he should have been acquitted or should not have been handed a stiff penalty, just that he shouldn\u2019t be executed, Nolan said.\n\n",

          "text": "\u201cThat\u2019s my duty, but it\u2019s hard work to get to it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe string of vaccination centers being built across the country come before Germany even has a vaccine to distribute. European approval of the Pfizer vaccine is expected sometime this month.\n\nThe German approach could be watched closely by the United States and other countries around the world as they eye ways to vaccinate their populations as speedily as possible.\n\nTime constraints are particularly pressing with the Pfizer vaccine \u2014 developed by the German firm BioNTech with German government funding \u2014 because of its cold storage requirements.\n\nThe vaccine can only survive for about five days after being defrosted from minus-94 degrees and comes in trays of just under 1,000 doses, so experts say it makes sense for people to come to a central location that can get as many people in and out as possible.\n\nBritain, which began giving its first vaccines through hospitals earlier this week, is also expected to open mass vaccination centers next year.\n\n\u201cWe asked the federal states to be ready by Dec. 15. And we are confident they will be,\u201d said Hanno Kautz, a spokesperson for Germany\u2019s Health Ministry.\n\nVaccination centers are being constructed because \u201cyou want to be quick,\u201d he said, and there simply isn\u2019t the space at hospitals, he said.\n\nConstruction is underway in all 16 German states. The central state of Hessen has said it will have 28 centers ready before the week is out, with the capacity to vaccinate 28,000 a day. Michael Schaich, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry said that operations have been tested, including a \u201cseamless logistics chain.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are well prepared,\u201d he said.\n\nThe western state Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg is setting up nine large centers for its 11 million people, with 44 more community vaccination points to be added in January.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better to have [vaccination centers] ready and there are delays than the other way around: having the vaccine and no vaccination centers ready to go,\u201d Health Minister Jens Spahn told reporters last week as he visited a new vaccination center in a D\u00fcsseldorf soccer ground set up to give 2,800 shots a day. The health ministry did not provide numbers on how many vaccination centers it expects to be ready next week.\n\nThe cost of Berlin\u2019s six centers will range between around $70 million and $95 million, according to Broemmer, with other federal states outlining similar investments.\n\nAt Arena Berlin, where Broemmer was overseeing the work, there are 80 small cubicles planned for the center designed to vaccinate 4,000 people a day. The aim is to vaccinate 450,000 people in Berlin \u2014 around 10 percent of the population \u2014 within three months.\n\nBut that will depend on supplies, and little is certain.\n\nBroemmer sketched out his plans for the space with a Lego brick model before handing them along to architects.\n\nCenters will have a waiting area where patients will be monitored for half an hour for side effects before they are allowed to leave.\n\nAbout 20 doctors will oversee the center at any one time, with about 150 staff members and volunteers. Those administering shots will be drawn from organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, and Broemmer said the city also was in discussions with airlines including Lufthansa and easyJet about using flight attendants who have first aid training.\n\nEurope has purchased an initial 200 million doses of the vaccine, double the initial order from the United States. But Germany has also secured an additional 40 million outside the European Union contract.\n\nGermany\u2019s federal states have scrambled to procure the deep freezers necessary for the vaccine storage. That was a challenge, Broemmer said.\n\n\u201cThe problem is to find these fridges,\u201d he said. \u201cWe ordered them two months ago, and we got them.\u201d\n\nThere are three for all Berlin, enough to store the 900,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine that it hopes to initially receive.\n\nIn Hessen, Schaich said that his state had also made an \u201cearly effort\u201d to get freezers without giving specifics. \u201cThere are only a few suppliers for this ultra-freezing,\u201d he said.\n\nBerlin\u2019s three freezers will be kept at a central location in the city, one of 27 \u201cdistribution hubs\u201d across the country, the location of which won\u2019t be made public for security reasons.\n\nThere are concerns that the centers could be targets for anti-vaxxers and followers of conspiracy theories. Germany has a vociferous anti-lockdown movement that has been becoming increasingly radicalized, with police still investigating an arson attack on the building of the federal agency for infectious-disease control in late October.\n\nOn Wednesday, the domestic intelligence agency in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, home to some of the largest demonstrations, said it would put their main organizers \u2014 a group called Querdenken 711 \u2014 under observation.\n\n\u201cWe never know what happens around, what happens at night,\u201d Broemmer said. \u201cThere might be arson or something like this. There might be some people that want to make trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe never know,\u201d he said.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, Germany has been quick to put in motion practical measures such as contact tracing, which took other countries months to roll out. However, now it\u2019s struggling to bring down the number of new cases, as daily deaths reach a record high.\n\nBroemmer was also responsible for overseeing the construction of an overspill hospital in an exhibition center in Berlin during the first wave of the pandemic last spring, which cost around $40 million but has not taken in a single patient.",

          "title": "Alex Olmedo, first male Latin American Grand Slam singles champion, dies at 84",
          "text": "Known as \u201cCacique\u201d or \u201cChief\u201d because of his Inca heritage, Mr. Olmedo was a 5-foot-10 right-hander who lit up the amateur tennis scene in the late 1950s, winning top tournaments nearly a decade before Grand Slam events were opened to professionals. Official, computerized tennis rankings were still years away, but at his peak in 1959 he was considered the top amateur in the United States and No. 2 in the world.\n\nRightly or not, he was also deemed one of the sport\u2019s most frustrating players, losing to second-rate opponents and struggling at times to elevate his game for matches he was expected to win. \u201cThere is nothing else quite like Olmedo in the formful world of tennis,\u201d Sports Illustrated journalist James Murray wrote in a 1959 cover story. \u201cHe is the world\u2019s best amateur tennis player one day. And he is plain run-of-the-mill the next.\u201d\n\nThe son of a groundskeeper and tennis instructor, Mr. Olmedo grew up playing at a local club in Arequipa, Peru\u2019s second-largest city. By most accounts, he came to the United States in 1954 after local supporters raised $700, enabling him to take a boat to Havana, a plane to Miami and a cross-country bus to Los Angeles. He spoke no English, and later spoke of a \u201cguardian angel\u201d watching over him on the Greyhound.\n\nHe went on to work at a tennis pro shop, where he said he \u201cstrung rackets and made malts and hamburgers\u201d while developing his game, ultimately catching the eye of Perry T. Jones, the czar of Southern California\u2019s amateur tennis scene. When Jones was named captain of America\u2019s 1958 Davis Cup squad, he successfully lobbied for Mr. Olmedo \u2014 by then winning NCAA titles for USC \u2014 to join the team.\n\nThe decision irritated some current and former tennis players, as Mr. Olmedo was not American (he later became a naturalized citizen) and the tournament was a showcase for national pride. But Peru wasn\u2019t fielding a team, and Mr. Olmedo silenced his critics after powering the United States to victory over Australia, ending a three-year winning streak by defeating Ashley Cooper, the reigning Wimbledon champion, in the finals on New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\n\u201cWe did it, Cap. We won,\u201d Mr. Olmedo yelled to Jones, shedding a few tears on the court and throwing his racket in celebration. He received a congratulatory telegram from actor Kirk Douglas (\u201cNow you are more than a chief. You are a superchief\u201d) and was crowned with a laurel wreath during a triumphant return to Peru.\n\nMr. Olmedo won his first Grand Slam championship that same year, partnering with Davis Cup teammate Ham Richardson to win the men\u2019s doubles title at the 1958 U.S. National Championships. Months later, he defeated Neale Fraser to win the 1959 Australian Championships, becoming only the second Latin American to win an individual Grand Slam title, after Chile\u2019s Anita Lizana won the U.S. Nationals in 1937.\n\nHis victory set him up for the No. 1 seed at Wimbledon, where he defeated 20-year-old Rod Laver in straight sets in the finals of the world\u2019s oldest tennis tournament. \u201cHe took his fast and aggressive game, and rocked the tennis world,\u201d the International Tennis Hall of Fame later said.\n\nMr. Olmedo and Brazilian Maria Bueno, who won the women\u2019s championship the next day, became the first South Americans to win individual titles at Wimbledon. He nearly won a third Grand Slam that year at the U.S. Nationals, where his former Australian opponent, Fraser, got revenge in the finals, winning in four sets.\n\nBut his success in major tournaments was accompanied by a number of disastrous matches. He was blamed for the American team\u2019s loss in the 1959 Davis Cup, when he dropped two matches in the final round, and was charged with throwing a clay-court match after a lackadaisical performance near Chicago.\n\nSports Illustrated later reported that Mr. Olmedo had not wanted to play in the clay tournament anyway, and was insulted when he arrived at the club and the gatekeeper didn\u2019t recognize him. In the predominantly White world of high-level tennis, he was sometimes mistaken for tournament staff.\n\n\u201cIn Europe people treat you much better. I feel better over there because they know a player is a human being over there,\u201d he said at the time. Exhausted by an amateur sports system in which he had to pay his own way to tournaments, then arrived to be treated poorly, he turned pro in December 1959, signing a contract that reportedly guaranteed him a minimum of $35,000.\n\nMr. Olmedo won the U.S. Pro Tennis Championships the next year and retired in 1965 with an overall record of 90-85. He was tired of traveling, he said, and wanted to focus on raising his family in Los Angeles, where he taught tennis until his death. He became the teaching pro at the Beverly Hills Hotel and worked with celebrities including Katharine Hepburn, Robert Duvall and Charlton Heston, describing himself as \u201ckind of a therapist\u201d on the tennis court, according to his son.\n\nGreeting clients with a standard line \u2014 \u201cHow you doing, champ?\u201d \u2014 he helped them with their serve or backhand while also chatting about life and work. \u201cThey come to see me to make themselves feel better about themselves,\u201d he would say, \u201cand to hit some tennis balls.\u201d\n\nThe second of seven children, Luis Alejandro Olmedo y Rodr\u00edguez was born in Arequipa on March 24, 1936. His family said that Mr. Olmedo started playing with a homemade wooden racket by age 4 or 5, and within a decade had beaten everyone in town. He went to Lima, the capital, where the head of the Peruvian tennis association connected him with American coach Stanley Singer, setting him on a path to come to the United States.\n\nMr. Olmedo was 15 when he made his amateur debut at the 1951 U.S. Nationals, losing his first match. His son and former wife, Ann Peirce Olmedo, said that he had already made his epic boat-plane-and-bus trip to Los Angeles by then, in contrast to news reports that suggested he made the journey three years later.\n\nBy all accounts, he learned English at night school soon after arriving, and studied at Modesto Junior College before enrolling at USC to play under tennis coach George Toley. He won NCAA doubles and individual championships in both 1956 and 1958, and helped lead the Trojans to a 1958 team championship.\n\nMr. Olmedo was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1987.\n\nHis marriage ended in divorce. In addition to his son, Alex Olmedo Jr. of Santa Monica, survivors include two daughters, Amy Olmedo of Los Angeles and Angie Williams of Paia, Hawaii; four brothers; a sister; and four grandchildren.\n\nIn a phone interview, his son recalled that Mr. Olmedo was still leading private lessons until shortly before his death, working with clients on an extra-wide, extra-long court that Mr. Olmedo had installed outside his home in Encino.\n\n\u201cWhen he was around people, he would just turn on the charm,\u201d Olmedo Jr. said. \u201cIf you were a beginner, he was so precise he could hit the ball exactly to your sweet spot and make you feel like you were a better player than you were. That\u2019s the key to being a pro, making people feel good about their abilities while also helping them improve. People would come back and say, \u2018What\u2019s going on, how come I can\u2019t play as well against other people as I do against you?\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd he\u2019d say, \u2018Well, champ, you\u2019ve got to keep coming back.\u2019 \u201d",

          "text": "But the bill is a sign of the fury detonated in Mexico by the detention of Cienfuegos in Los Angeles in October. The legislation was proposed by the office of President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, whose party holds a majority in Congress. It sailed through the Senate on Wednesday night and is expected to clear the lower house soon.\n\nThe measure would require that Mexican federal, state and local officials get permission from a high-level security panel to talk with \u201cforeign agents\u201d such as those working for the FBI or Drug Enforcement Administration. The Mexican officials would be required to provide a written report about such meetings to the Foreign and Public Security ministries. A representative of the Foreign Ministry would have to sit in on the sessions.\n\n\u201cIt will dramatically change the way Mexican law enforcement and U.S. law enforcement cooperate,\u201d said Ana Mar\u00eda Salazar, a Mexico City-based security analyst who worked in drug enforcement under the Clinton administration. \u201cThe extreme requirements will probably paralyze the relationship.\u201d\n\nThe measure could affect a wide range of investigations \u2014 involving drug-trafficking, money-laundering, kidnapping and other crimes.\n\nU.S. agents are unlikely to share sensitive information under such conditions because it could easily fall into the hands of corrupt officials if distributed widely, former officials say. \u201cThat would compromise agents, informants and investigations,\u201d said Mike Vigil, a former chief of international operations for the DEA.\n\nU.S. Attorney General William P. Barr said in a statement that the Justice Department was \u201ctroubled\u201d by the legislation, which he said would complicate bilateral cooperation. \u201cThe passage of this legislation can only benefit the violent transnational criminal organizations and other criminals that we are jointly fighting,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother department official said the measure could have a dramatic impact on bilateral relations. \u201cThe immediate effect is a freeze\u201d on sharing information, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to give interviews.\n\nDrug cooperation is particularly important because Mexico is the main source of heroin and methamphetamines in the United States, as well as a major gateway for cocaine and fentanyl.\n\nRoberto Velasco, the senior official handling U.S. affairs at the Foreign Ministry, said diplomats had met with officials from the State and Justice departments to explain details of the bill. \u201cIt is in our shared interest to continue working together on law enforcement,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe aim of the bill is for our cooperation to continue on the basis of mutual respect, and shared objectives.\u201d\n\nCienfuegos served as defense minister from 2012 to 2018, under President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. He was charged in October in U.S. federal court with helping the H-2 drug cartel, based in northwestern Mexico, to ship heroin, cocaine and methamphetamines to the United States. He pleaded not guilty. Many Mexicans said they believed him; Cienfuegos was not widely perceived as corrupt and had worked on anti-drug efforts with U.S. officials.\n\nThe detention was seen in Mexico as a slap at the military \u2014 which is highly regarded and has become a central player in L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s security and infrastructure plans. Mexico responded to the arrest by threatening to curtail security cooperation with the United States. The Trump administration dropped the charges citing \u201cforeign policy considerations\u201d and sent Cienfuegos home. But that wasn\u2019t the end of the story.\n\nMexican officials have portrayed the law as necessary to guarantee their sovereignty. \u201cI think there\u2019s a national awakening\u201d after the Cienfuegos case, said Ricardo Monreal, a ruling-party lawmaker who guided the legislation through the Senate. \u201cWe want a harmonious relationship with the United States, but not one of subordination.\u201d\n\nHe said the language in the legislation was originally harsher. \u201cIt was moderated because the president wants a good relationship\u201d with Washington, he said.\n\nForeign Ministry officials noted that many parts of the legislation, such as providing only limited diplomatic immunity for foreign agents, are copied from bilateral agreements reached years ago. But the legislation adds new provisions. And it is part of the national security law, which allows criminal charges \u2014 even treason \u2014 against violators, noted Jorge Lara, a former senior Mexican justice official.\n\n\u201cThis will result in many people preferring not to take the risk\u201d of meeting with U.S. agents, he said. \u201cThis will generate a kind of paranoia.\u201d\n\nThe law was introduced during a political vacuum in the United States, with the Trump administration on the brink of leaving office and a Biden team not yet confirmed. Mexican diplomats insist L\u00f3pez Obrador wants a good relationship with the incoming U.S. leader. But Lara said the Mexican government could be using the measure to gain leverage with Biden.Senior members of the armed forces were infuriated by the arrest of Cienfuegos, whom many had served with over the years. The case was built in the United States, relying on intercepted BlackBerry messages allegedly involving the general and drug traffickers. But it sparked alarm among other senior members of the Mexican government who feared that the DEA might be tapping their phones.\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador, a longtime leftist, has developed a surprisingly warm relationship with President Trump. But he also relies heavily on Mexico\u2019s military, both for domestic security and numerous other duties, from building a new Mexico City airport to transporting medications during the coronavirus pandemic.",
