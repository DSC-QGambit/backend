However, Israel has warned people that they will not be allowed to enter the north of the war-torn enclave.\n\nVideos obtained by Al Jazeera showed Palestinians returning to their homes in Beit Lahiya in the northern Gaza Strip, despite the Israeli army\u2019s insistence that it is a combat zone.\n\nThe Israeli military has said that it expects Hamas would try to encourage or push civilians to return to the northern part of the Gaza Strip, and that they were prepared to prevent it from happening, Al Jazeera\u2019s Mohammed Jamjoom reported from occupied East Jerusalem.\n\nCiting witnesses, Palestinian news agency Wafa said that seven people were wounded by Israeli forces as they attempted to go to northern Gaza.\n\nSeveral have been injured and taken back to hospitals in the south of the territory, reports Al Jazeera\u2019s Tareq Abu Azzoum from Khan Younis in southern Gaza.\n\nAn Israeli military spokesperson, Avichay Adrei, released a statement in Arabic on X.\n\n#\u0639\u0627\u062c\u0644 \u064a\u0627 \u0633\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u063a\u0632\u0629\u060c \u0644\u0646 \u064a\u064f\u0633\u0645\u062d \u0628\u0623\u064a \u0634\u0643\u0644 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0634\u0643\u0627\u0644 \u0628\u062a\u0646\u0642\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u062c\u0646\u0648\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0637\u0627\u0639 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0634\u0645\u0627\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0625\u0646\u0645\u0627 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0646\u0648\u0628 \u0641\u0642\u0637. \u0646\u062f\u0639\u0648\u0643\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0639\u062f\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0642\u062a\u0631\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0648\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0633\u0643\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0637\u0642 \u0634\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0648\u0627\u062f\u064a \u063a\u0632\u0629. \u0627\u0633\u062a\u063a\u0644\u0648\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0642\u062a \u0644\u0644\u062a\u0632\u0648\u062f \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0627\u062d\u062a\u064a\u0627\u062c\u0627\u062a \u0648\u062a\u0631\u062a\u064a\u0628 \u0623\u0645\u0648\u0631\u0643\u0645. \u0645\u0646\u0637\u0642\u0629 \u0634\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0637\u0627\u0639 \u0647\u064a \u0645\u0646\u0637\u0642\u0629 \u0642\u062a\u0627\u0644 \u0648\u064a\u062d\u0638\u0631\u2026 pic.twitter.com/PmdUpytJD7 \u2014 \u0627\u0641\u064a\u062e\u0627\u064a \u0627\u062f\u0631\u0639\u064a (@AvichayAdraee) November 24, 2023\n\n\u201cResidents of Gaza, the movement of the population from the south of the Strip to the north will not be allowed in any way, but only from the north to the south,\u201d it read.\n\n\u201cWe invite you not to approach the military forces and the areas north of the Gaza Valley. Take advantage of the time to replenish your needs and arrange your affairs,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe area north of the Gaza Strip is a combat zone and it is forbidden to stay there. The war is not over and we urge you to obey the teachings and warnings for your safety,\u201d Adrei added.\n\n\u2018Everything is broken\u2019\n\nMany people no longer have a home to go back to after seven weeks of Israeli bombardment and ground invasions that started on October 7.\n\nGaza resident Ashraf Shann told Al Jazeera that he had mixed feelings about the truce.\n\n\u201cI have nowhere to go back to even if [the Israelis] allow us to go back to Gaza City. My house was bombed and completely destroyed on the third day of the war,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, I\u2019m happy for those people whose loved ones are missing. At least they can go and pick up the pieces and try to search for them.\u201d\n\nZak Hania, a displaced Palestinian who fled the Shati refugee camp, said \u201ceverything is broken in Gaza\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know whether to be happy or sad. Our houses are broken, our hearts are broken, everything is broken in Gaza now. We do not know how life will continue after this,\u201d he told Al Jazeera from the southern city of Khan Younis.\n\nAsked if he was planning to head home during the truce, Hania responded: \u201cWe can\u2019t go because the Israeli army said nobody\u2019s allowed to go back to the north and people are afraid and hesitant to go.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s dangerous to go back because they\u2019re still on the road separating the north and south of Gaza \u2026 We\u2019re not sure about anything and we\u2019re just praying that the ceasefire holds,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nResumption of war looming\n\nHani Mahmoud, reporting from Khan Younis in southern Gaza, said the looming fact that the war will resume in a matter of days was a huge disappointment for people.\n\n\u201cThere is a sense of happiness, a sense of optimism, but it is a cautious optimism because after 48 days of relentless air strikes and killings, so many Palestinians have been surrounded by destruction and blood, and the bodies of loved ones and family members,\u201d Mahmoud said.\n\n\u201cThe ceasefire comes when people want to take a moment and just check on each other and check on their homes and belongings,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere is also the looming fact that the war will resume in a matter of days, according to Israeli officials,\u201d Mahmoud said.\n\n\u201cThat statement was very devastating and depressing for many Palestinians who believe this ceasefire is incomplete and unfair as they want to go and check on their homes and see who is left among their family members,\u201d he said.\n\nIsrael\u2019s war has killed more than 14,800 people in Gaza since October 7. In Israel, the official death toll from Hamas\u2019s attacks that prompted the war stands at about 1,200.",

          "text": "Aid begins to trickle in to Gaza as the first pause begins after seven weeks of hostilities between Israel and Hamas.\n\nA Qatar-mediated four-day truce has taken effect in Israel\u2019s war on Gaza. The first pause after seven weeks of bombardment has been met with relief by Palestinians.\n\nDuring the humanitarian break in the fighting, which began at 7am (05:00 GMT) on Friday, 150 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails and 50 captives held by the Hamas armed group in Gaza are due to be released.\n\nThe first releases, which will see 39 Palestinians and 13 Israelis freed, are expected on Friday afternoon.\n\nIn the hours preceding the start of the truce, Israeli bombing intensified across the Gaza Strip, with attacks in Rafah and the city of Khan Younis in the south, as well as constant artillery shelling in the north of the enclave.\n\nAlmog Boker, a correspondent for the Israeli station Channel 13, has posted a video online showing Israeli soldiers celebrating from afar as a number of buildings were destroyed in the northern Gaza Strip in the last hour before the start of the truce.\n\n\u05d1\u05e9\u05e2\u05d4 \u05d4\u05d0\u05d7\u05e8\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4 \u05e9\u05dc\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d4\u05e4\u05e1\u05e7\u05ea \u05d4\u05d0\u05e9, \u05db\u05d5\u05d7\u05d5\u05ea \u05e6\u05d4\"\u05dc \u05d4\u05e9\u05de\u05d9\u05d3\u05d5 \u05ea\u05d5\u05d5\u05d0\u05d9 \u05de\u05e0\u05d4\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05ea\u05ea \u05e7\u05e8\u05e7\u05e2\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea \u05d5\u05de\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \u05e4\u05d9\u05e8\u05d9 \u05de\u05e0\u05d4\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05d1\u05de\u05e8\u05d7\u05d1 \u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05d4\u05d7\u05d5\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd \u05e9\u05d9\u05e4\u05d0\u05d0'. \u05db\u05da \u05d6\u05d4 \u05e0\u05e8\u05d0\u05d4 \u05d5\u05e0\u05e9\u05de\u05e2: pic.twitter.com/FHabuf2C6r \u2014 almog boker (@bokeralmog) November 24, 2023\n\nThe first pause in the fighting was met with huge relief by Palestinians, who were rejoicing to be safe from Israeli bombardment for the first time in weeks, Al Jazeera\u2019s Tareq Abu Azzoum reported from Khan Younis, southern Gaza.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time that we have not heard Israeli drones since the beginning of this round of fighting,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople sense that there is a glimmer of hope that this short-term pause will pave the way for a longer ceasefire.\u201d\n\nBadly needed aid\n\nUnder the deal, badly needed aid will be allowed into Gaza. The enclave has been under a total Israeli blockade since the war was triggered by Hamas\u2019s attack on October 7.\n\nEgypt said 130,000 litres of diesel and four trucks of gas will be delivered daily to Gaza over the four days. Overall, 200 trucks carrying aid are set to enter Gaza daily.\n\nAl Jazeera\u2019s Youmna ElSayed, reporting from the Rafah border crossing, said the flow of trucks carrying fuel and gas had begun.\n\nAdditional aid would start entering into and the first captives, including elderly women, would be freed at 4pm (14:00 GMT), said Qatar\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari in Doha. The total number of hostages to be freed by Hamas will rise to 50 over the four days.\n\nMonitoring truce\n\nQatar will monitor the truce in real time for possible violations, reported Al Jazeera\u2019s James Bays from Doha.\n\n\u201cQatar has an operations room here in Doha where they are going to get real-time information from Gaza. They have direct links with the Israeli military, with Hamas,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe idea is that if there is any sort of violation, that because of those direct links, they are going to try and nip it in the bud and make sure that this truce can continue, that this process can continue for the four days,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\n\n\nFighting raged on in the hours leading up to the truce, with officials inside the Hamas-ruled enclave saying a hospital in Gaza City was among the targets bombed.\n\nBoth sides also signalled the pause would be temporary before fighting resumes.\n\nThe Indonesian Hospital was reeling under relentless bombing, operating without light and filled with bedridden old people and children too weak to be moved, Gaza health officials said.\n\nMunir al-Bursh, the Gaza health ministry director, told Al Jazeera that a wounded woman was killed and three others injured.\n\nIsrael launched its devastating invasion of Gaza after gunmen from Hamas burst across the border fence on October 7, killing 1,200 people and seizing about 240 captives, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nSince then, Israel has rained bombs on the besieged enclave, killing more than 14,000 people in Gaza, about 40 percent of them children, according to Palestinian health authorities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018I want to go home\u2019\n\nAs soon as the fighting paused, thousands of displaced Palestinians have set out to check on their homes in central and southern areas of the enclave reports Al Jazeera\u2019s Wael Dahdouh from Khan Younis.\n\n\u201cOne man said, \u2018I want to go home and even if it is destroyed, I want to stay there. I want to die there\u2019,\u201d the correspondent reported.\n\n\u201cOne woman with a child said, \u2018I pray that these days will get longer and longer, to just feel safe for a day or two\u2019.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Israeli military said its forces will be stationed at the truce lines and will not allow Palestinians to head to northern Gaza.",

          "text": "[1/4] People hold a banner during a Black Friday strike outside the Amazon warehouse, in Coventry, Britain November 24, 2023. REUTERS/Phil Noble Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nLONDON, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Amazon (AMZN.O) workers came out on strike at multiple locations across Europe on Friday as protests against the U.S. e-commerce giant's working practices picked up pace on one of the busiest shopping days of the year.\n\n\"Make Amazon Pay\", a global campaign coordinated by UNI Global Union, said strikes and protests would take place in more than 30 countries from so-called \"Black\" Friday through to Monday.\n\nMany retailers slash prices to boost sales on Black Friday, the day after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nOriginally known for crowds lining up at big-box stores in the U.S., the event has increasingly moved online and gone global, fuelled in part by Amazon, which advertises ten days of holiday discounts this year from Nov. 17 to Nov. 27.\n\nIn Germany, Amazon's second-biggest market by sales last year, workers at five fulfilment centres in Bad Hersfeld, Dortmund, Koblenz, Leipzig, and Rheinberg started a 24-hour strike at midnight on Thursday to demand a collective wage agreement, trade union Verdi said.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson in Germany said workers are paid fair wages, with a starting salary of more than 14 euros ($15.27) an hour, and have additional benefits. The spokesperson said deliveries of Black Friday orders will be reliable and timely.\n\nMore than 200 workers were striking on Friday at Amazon's warehouse in Coventry, England as part of a long-running dispute over pay.\n\nNick Henderson, a worker at the Coventry warehouse, which acts as a logistics hub for Amazon to process products to send to other warehouses, said he was striking for higher pay and better working conditions.\n\nThe striking workers were chanting their demand for a pay rise to 15 pounds ($18.69) an hour.\n\nAn Amazon UK spokesperson said minimum starting pay is between 11.80 pounds and 13 pounds an hour depending on location, and would increase to 12.30 to 13 pounds an hour from April 2024. Amazon said the strike would not cause disruption.\n\nItalian trade union CGIL called for a Black Friday strike at the Castel San Giovanni warehouse, while Spanish union CCOO called for Amazon warehouse and delivery workers to stage a one-hour strike on each shift on \"Cyber Monday\", the last day of Amazon's ten-day sale.\n\nAmazon's parcel lockers - located in train stations, supermarket car parks, and street corners, and used by many customers to receive orders - are also being targeted.\n\nIn France, anti-globalisation organisation Attac is encouraging activists to plaster them with posters and ticker tape, potentially blocking delivery workers and customers from being able to open them.\n\nAttac, which calls Black Friday a \"celebration of overproduction and overconsumption\", said it expects the protest to be wider than last year, when it estimates 100 Amazon lockers across France were targeted.\n\nAmazon has remained popular in Europe even as rivals like Shein and Temu have seen rapid growth. Amazon's app had 146 million active users in Europe in October, compared to 64 million for Shein and 51 million for Temu, according to data.ai.\n\nReuters Graphics\n\n($1 = 0.9168 euros)\n\n($1 = 0.8025 pounds)\n\nReporting by Helen Reid and James Davey in London, Phil Noble in Coventry, Matthias Inverardi in Dusseldorf, Elisa Anzolin in Milan, Corina Pons in Madrid, Editing by Sharon Singleton\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights\n\nBERLIN, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Germany's economy shrank slightly in the third quarter compared with the previous three months, data from its statistics office showed on Friday.\n\nThe figure confirmed an initial estimate, published in late October, that saw Europe's largest economy shrink by 0.1%.\n\n\"After the weak economic development seen in the first half of 2023, the German economy began the second half of the year with a slight drop in performance,\" said Ruth Brand, president of the statistics office.\n\nGermany has been among the weakest economies in Europe this year as high energy costs, weak global orders and higher interest rates have taken their toll.\n\nIn the second quarter, Germany's economy had grown by 0.1% after stagnating in the first three months of the year.\n\nAdjusted gross domestic product (GDP) contracted by 0.4% year-on-year in the third quarter.\n\nPrivate consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of GDP, was 0.3% lower than in the previous quarter, the statistics office said. Government consumer spending increased for the first time in more than a year by 0.2%, it added.\n\nA court ruling that blocked the transfer of unused funds from the pandemic to green investment and blew a 60 billion euro ($65.44 billion) hole in the government's budget has led to major uncertainty, particularly among industry, about planned investments.\n\n\"Government austerity measures could lead to an additional dampening of growth,\" said VP Bank Chief Economist Thomas Gitzel, adding \"it is unlikely that private consumption or investment will suddenly pick up.\"\n\nThe Bundesbank said in its monthly economic report on Monday that the German economy will likely shrink again in the fourth quarter and show signs of slight improvement early next year.\n\n($1 = 0.9168 euros)\n\nReporting by Miranda Murray; Editing by Linda Pasquini and Jamie Freed\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

          "text": "NEW YORK, Nov 24 (Reuters) - Retailers are hoping forecasts for a cool, dry Black Friday across much of the U.S. will drive millions of shoppers to their stores in the kickoff to the key holiday shopping season.\n\nBut with many shoppers facing financial pressure, U.S. holiday spending is expected to rise at the slowest pace in five years. Most major retailers slashed their seasonal hiring.\n\n\"Consumers are still being very cautious, so if holiday sales do go up, we think it will be due to inflation raising prices,\" said Jessica Ramirez, a senior research analyst at Jane Hali & Associates.\n\nU.S. shoppers plan to spend an average $875 on holiday purchases -- $42 more than last year -- with clothing, gift cards and toys at the top of most shopping lists, according to a survey of 8,424 adults conducted in early November by the National Retail Federation, a U.S. retail trade group.\n\nArea chart with data from Insider Intelligence shows retail e-commerce sales in the U.S. from Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday in 2017 to 2023, with 2023 as forecast.\n\nA record 130.7 million people are expected to shop in-store and online in the U.S. on Black Friday this year, it estimates.\n\nOriginally known for crowds lining up at big-box stores in the U.S., Black Friday has moved online and gone global.\n\nIn France, Italy, and Spain, most shoppers planned to buy clothing on Black Friday, with electronic goods coming second, according to a PwC survey.\n\nOn average, shoppers in France expected to spend 295 euros ($322) on Black Friday according to the survey.\n\nExecutives say the rise of online shopping has made Black Friday less important as a single-day event. Retailers from Macy's to Amazon now launch deals as early as October and often offer additional discounts closer to Christmas, Macy's CEO Jeff Gennette told investors this month.\n\nMost U.S. stores were closed on Thanksgiving but will open to shoppers at 5 a.m. or 6 a.m. on Friday. A coalition of activist organizations, including antiwar group \"Act Now to Stop War and End Racism,\" has called for \"disruptions and rallies\" at major commercial centers on Black Friday to demand a ceasefire and end of aid to Israel. The New York Police Department said on Wednesday that \"there are currently no credible threats to any individual event or to New York City in general\" over the holiday weekend.\n\nIn post-earnings calls this week, retailers from Kohl's (KSS.N) to Nordstrom (JWN.N) told investors they had invested in jackets, cashmere sweaters and Ugg boots to lure Christmas shoppers after an unseasonably warm October. Macy\u2019s (M.N) also touted Black Friday deals on seasonal attire, including 60% to 65% off men\u2019s and women\u2019s coats, according to its website.\n\nWaffle chart with survey data from the National Retail Federation shows the rising number of returns in US retail sales from 2018 to 2022.\n\nTo be sure, some retailers hold their biggest markdowns for the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, and big-box players including Walmart (WMT.N), Lowe\u2019s (LOW.N) and Home Depot (HD.N) maintained or deepened their advertised discounts.\n\nWhether those deals will convince inflation-weary consumers to open their wallets is the biggest worry for retailers on Friday. Several categories of merchandise that were top sellers on Black Friday in previous years have been hit hardest by the recent downturn in discretionary spending, said Mari Shor, a senior equity analyst at Columbia Threadneedle Investments.\n\nBest Buy (BBY.N), for instance, is offering between $100 and $1,600 off electronics including laptops, flat-screen TVs and KitchenAid mixers after telling investors this week that shoppers are still holding off on big-ticket purchases.\n\nA downturn in luxury spending has also prompted department stores, including Bergdorf Goodman and Nordstrom to offer steep discounts on items such as Balenciaga shoes and Oscar de la Renta earrings. \u201cDesigner remains pressured, primarily in shoes and handbags, and we continue to right-size our inventory to meet that demand,\u201d Nordstrom President Pete Nordstrom told investors on Tuesday.\n\nMall owner Westfield said it expects more visitors to its shopping centres in Britain this year than in 2022, with footfall up more than 6% so far this week, according to Katie Wyle, head of shopping centre management UK at Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield.\n\n($1 = 0.9168 euros)\n\nReporting by Katherine Masters, additional reporting by Mimosa Spencer in Paris and Helen Reid in London; Editing by Josie Kao and Miral Fahmy\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

The planned four-day pause would begin at 7 a.m. local time Friday, with the first group of hostages to be released later in the day, Majed Al Ansari, a spokesperson for the Qatar Foreign Ministry said Thursday. He added that the pause was delayed by last-minute logistical issues, including the verification of the list of hostages set to be released.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know about the release of hostages from Gaza.\n\nThe facts\n\nThe first group of hostages \u2014 13 women and children \u2014 would be transferred at 4 p.m. Friday, Qatar said Thursday. At least 50 hostages \u2014 women and children \u2014 will be released during the four-day pause in fighting, the Israeli government said Wednesday.\n\nIn turn, Israel will release 150 Palestinian prisoners \u2014 women and children aged 14 and over \u2014 or three for each hostage. The pause in fighting could be extended by a day for every additional 10 hostages released by Hamas from Gaza after the first group of 50.\n\nThree Americans \u2014 two women and a girl \u2014 are expected to be released under the present agreement, a senior Biden administration official told The Washington Post.\n\nThe hostages are likely to be transferred to the International Committee of the Red Cross in small numbers, which would escort them to the Gaza border.\n\nIn Israel, six hospitals have been readied to receive the hostages with a special pediatrics unit and mental health counselors. The hostages and their families will be housed in dedicated facilities, and the hospitals would be barred from releasing information or photographs to the public, the Israeli Ministry of Health said.\n\nWho are the hostages being released?\n\nOn Thursday, Israeli officials received the list of names of hostages who will be released in the first batch on Friday, and has contacted their families, they said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe estimated 240 people held in Gaza are from a plurality of countries, many also with Israeli citizenship. Some 25 Thai workers were among those taken, the Thai Foreign Ministry said. They are hoped to be among the first released, it said Nov. 2, after talks with Iran, Egypt and Qatar before the hostage release deal. Not all hostages are believed to be held by Hamas; smaller militant groups such as Palestinian Islamic Jihad are potentially in control of some.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nAfter the initial captives exchange is completed, there will still be about 190 remaining hostages in Gaza, though the deal leaves open the possibility of further exchanges. Israeli and U.S. officials believe there are at least another 25, and perhaps another 50 or more, women and children among the hostages, with the remaining including male civilians, female Israeli soldiers, and up to several dozen male members of the Israel Defense Forces, The Post reported Wednesday. Hamas has claimed that some hostages were killed in Israeli strikes on Gaza, but verifying that information has not been possible.\n\nWere other hostages released earlier?\n\nFour hostages have been released by Hamas since the beginning of the war, in two batches of two about a month ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Oct. 20, Americans Judith Raanan, 59, and her daughter Natalie, 17, were released. Hamas said that this was due to \u201chumanitarian reasons,\u201d without elaborating further. They had been staying with relatives at the Nahal Oz, a kibbutz near the border with Gaza, when they were taken captive during Hamas\u2019s unprecedented attack Oct. 7 that killed at least 1,200 in Israel. More than 13,300 people have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war and 35,180 wounded, the Gaza Health Ministry said Thursday, adding that the number did not include figures from two major hospitals.\n\nOn Oct. 23, Yocheved Lifshitz and Nurit Cooper, Israeli women in their 70s and 80s, were released, for \u201ccrushing humanitarian reasons,\u201d Hamas said. Their husbands remain in captivity.\n\nHow many American hostages are there?\n\nAt least nine Americans and one legal permanent resident are believed to be among those held in Gaza, The Post reported previously. One is a 3-year-old child whose parents were killed in the Oct. 7 attack.\n\nBiden said that Americans would be among those freed under the newly announced deal. \u201cToday\u2019s deal should bring home additional American hostages, and I will not stop until they are all released,\u201d he said in his statement Wednesday.\n\nSteve Hendrix contributed to this report.",

          "text": "Listen 12 min Share Comment on this story Comment Add to your saved stories Save\n\nANN ARBOR, Mich. \u2014 University of Michigan senior Bhavani Iyer, 21, stayed in line to vote until 1 a.m. last November to help reelect Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and vote on a ballot measure to codify the right to abortion in the state. Keeping up with politics is easy with The 5-Minute Fix Newsletter, in your inbox weekdays. ArrowRight The 21-year-old considers herself a Democrat, but sitting here on the Diag \u2014 an open area on the center of campus where students gather between classes and club meetings \u2014 she said she doesn\u2019t know if she will support President Biden\u2019s reelection bid next November. One of her top priorities is protecting access to abortion, but her disapproval of Biden\u2019s handling of the Israel-Gaza war and his decision not to call for a full cease-fire weighs just as heavily on her mind these days.\n\n\u201cIn past elections, I voted a straight ticket,\u201d said Iyer, who is now weighing third-party options but is still unsure whom she would support. \u201cBut in this one, I feel like it\u2019s probably not going to be that way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSitting on a concrete bench with friends Andrea Gonzalez and Humza Irfan last week as fellow students rushed through the campus hub, all three of the young, typically reliably blue voters expressed their own moral conflict about how to vote \u2014 or whether to vote at all \u2014 in next year\u2019s presidential contest.\n\nGonzalez, a 19-year-old whose parents are immigrants, said that she feels a deep sense of responsibility to cast her vote in what will be her first time participating in a presidential election but that she is torn over what she feels is a lack of options. While she feels disdain for former president Donald Trump and his years of controversial rhetoric toward women, immigrants and people of color, Biden\u2019s stance on the war makes it difficult to decide where she leans. And Irfan, 21, who said his enthusiasm for the incumbent president has been diminished by the war, noted the conflict has changed Biden\u2019s standing overall among Muslims, many of whom feel he has shown a lack of sympathy for Palestinian civilians.\n\nThe uncertainty shared by the three friends is emblematic of the broader disapproval many young voters across the country have voiced over Biden\u2019s handling of the Israel-Gaza war. Gen Z and millennial voters \u2014 defined as those born from 1997 to 2012 and 1981 to 1996, respectively \u2014 have typically supported Democratic candidates, and young people were key to flipping swing states such as Michigan blue and securing Biden\u2019s win in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut conversations with more than a dozen students here underscore that Biden\u2019s handling of the war threatens to diminish enthusiasm for him among young voters ahead of the 2024 election, with many students and other young people divided on how they will use their vote and their organizing power. Against the backdrop of concerns about Biden\u2019s age, a number of liberal students here expressed openness to third-party candidates and frustration with a likely Trump-Biden rematch, signaling they would shift the focus of their volunteering down-ballot as a result.\n\nThe Gaza Health Ministry said Thursday that more than 13,300 people have been killed since the start of the war and 35,180 wounded. About 6,000 people are missing, according to the ministry, whose figures were dated Tuesday.\n\nIsrael approved a deal with Hamas early Wednesday to temporarily pause fighting in the Gaza Strip in exchange for the release of at least 50 of about 240 hostages held inside the enclave, bringing a four-day halt to the war. But that pause \u2014 the first major de-escalatory step since the war began \u2014 falls short of the permanent cease-fire that young voters, in interviews before the deal was confirmed, said that they want to see.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiden has remained unapologetic in his defense of Israel, writing in an op-ed for The Washington Post on Saturday: \u201cAs long as Hamas clings to its ideology of destruction, a cease-fire is not peace.\u201d\n\nAmericans overall continue to side strongly with Israel, but polling shows those views have grown increasingly polarized across party and generation since even before the war. An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll earlier this month found 48 percent of Gen Z and millennial adults said Israel\u2019s military response has been \u201ctoo much,\u201d compared with 38 percent of the public overall. Most young adults disapprove of Biden\u2019s handling of the situation, according to national polls this month by Fox News, Quinnipiac University and Marist College. And a recent poll from NBC News found that 70 percent of voters age 18 to 34 disapprove of Biden\u2019s handling of the war.\n\nMany experts and activists over the years have attributed the divide to younger generations\u2019 disapproval of the right-wing politics of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli blockade of Gaza and occupation of the West Bank, and comparisons between the treatment of minorities in the United States and Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAfter what\u2019s happening right now in the Middle East, it\u2019s a very difficult decision for people from my background who we\u2019re going to be voting for,\u201d said Irfan, who is Pakistani American and said a relative was killed last month in an apparent Israeli strike.\n\nGen Z and millennial voters are expected to make up nearly 40 percent of the electorate in 2024 and have already flexed their influence on elections. They helped flip the Wisconsin Supreme Court earlier this year to a liberal majority, and they boosted turnout on college campuses in Pennsylvania and Virginia in this month\u2019s elections. Polling showed young voters were highly motivated by issues such as abortion, in which there is a clear contrast between the stances of Biden and Trump, the front-runner for the GOP nomination.\n\nBut a diminished turnout among young voters could complicate Biden\u2019s reelection bid, especially in key battleground states such as Michigan. Biden flipped the state in 2020, and network exit polls found 61 percent of Michigan voters ages 18 to 29 supported his campaign.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe are working hard to highlight how an extreme MAGA agenda would devastate the financial security, safety, and freedom of young people, and how President Biden and Vice President Harris are fighting for the future that America\u2019s young people deserve,\u201d Biden-Harris spokesperson Kevin Munoz said in a statement. \u201cAs Democrats did in 2020 and 2022, we will meet younger Americans where they are and earn their votes.\u201d\n\nShare this article Share\n\nA Democratic National Committee official pointed to the recent hire of a youth coalitions director and an already launched relational organizing pilot program focused on young voters in Wisconsin as efforts to invest early in infrastructure to organize the youth vote ahead of next year\u2019s election.\n\nBut support for Biden among young people was waning long before the war \u2014 with University of Michigan students outlining their disappointment over unmet promises on policies such as climate change and student loan forgiveness and concerns about his age.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBreah Marie Willy, 19, said she was previously excited to vote for president for the first time in 2024, but now she is not sure whom to vote for. She had hoped other Democrats would challenge Biden and was disappointed in his approval of the Willow Project, a major oil development in Alaska. His stance on a cease-fire has caused a bigger fissure, with her friends now referring to him as \u201cGenocide Joe,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe all have TikTok, we all have Instagram. And it\u2019s honestly like we\u2019ve begun to form these parasocial relationships with the people in Palestine,\u201d Willy said, citing posts by a creator named Bisan Owda who shares videos from inside Gaza.\n\nAs students weigh their 2024 options, some liberal students such as Willy said they are open to voting for a third-party candidate, even if doing so could boost Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong those willing to take that risk is Joseph Fisher, 20, who now sees a third-party vote as a broader effort to push back against the two-party system.\n\n\u201cI just can\u2019t see how I can ever muster up the courage a year from now to walk to a ballot box and vote for this person that has directly been responsible for so much harm,\u201d he said of Biden.\n\nA self-described former \u201cBernie bro,\u201d Fisher was too young to vote in 2020 and instead volunteered on the youth council of his local NAACP in Cobb County, Ga., a fast-growing suburb of metropolitan Atlanta that helped turn the state blue.\n\nNow as the political action chair of the Black Student Union and the activism chair of Students Allied for Freedom and Equality, the University of Michigan chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine, he echoed disapproval of Biden\u2019s performance and is seriously considering supporting Claudia De la Cruz, who is running a long-shot presidential campaign on the Party for Socialism and Liberation ticket.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nZaynab Elkolaly, 22, another member of SAFE, said she voted for Biden in 2020 as a form of harm reduction compared with Trump but doesn\u2019t believe casting her vote for an outside candidate is the best strategy.\n\n\u201cThe general sentiment [on campus] towards Joe Biden is that he absolutely sucks. But we have to put up with him because his alternative is even worse,\u201d Elkolaly said.\n\nEarlier this month, several leaders of national youth organizing groups penned a letter to the Biden administration calling for a cease-fire and warning that the president\u2019s stance on Israel could lower youth voter turnout in the presidential election.\n\n\u201cYou and your Administration\u2019s stance on Gaza risks millions of young voters staying home or voting third party next year,\u201d the letter read, adding that it \u201cwill not be possible for those committed to turning out the youth vote this election to recruit the volunteers, organizers, staff, and donors needed to deliver the margins for Democratic victory down the ballot.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to be mobilizing the youth vote; it\u2019s another to be asking for people\u2019s time to help make sure that others are doing the same,\u201d said Michele Weindling, the political director of the youth climate group Sunrise Movement and a signee of the letter.\n\nJack Petocz, mobilization coordinator for Gen-Z for Change, said motivating young voters to support Biden in 2024 is a harder sell in the wake of war. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen this kind of frustration and energy from my generation before,\u201d he said.\n\nBeyond those pushing a cease-fire, some Democratic students who support Biden\u2019s backing of Israel expressed other frustrations with his candidacy or offered suggestions on how he can better his message to their peers.\n\nSari Rosenberg, 21, does not support a cease-fire in the current climate without the return of all hostages held by Hamas but argued that Biden should be more critical of Netanyahu.\n\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s important that we have Israel as an ally, but I don\u2019t think Biden has been critical enough of the far-right government and a lot of the things that they\u2019re trying to impose,\u201d said Rosenberg, a Democrat who is chair of the undergraduate governing board of University of Michigan Hillel. \u201cI think that Biden does not really take that into account.\u201d\n\nRosenberg said that it feels as though Democrats could do better than \u201can old White man\u201d as president, and that she wishes other strong candidates had jumped into the race, citing her concern that Biden is \u201cstarting to deteriorate ... age-wise.\u201d Still, she plans to vote for him next November.\n\nMembers of College Democrats at the University of Michigan, some of the president\u2019s top defenders on campus, said they believe at the end of the day that their peers will turn out for Biden, especially when confronted with Trump as the alternative \u2014 even as some acknowledged that the president could improve his messaging around the war.\n\n\u201cI understand some folks\u2019 frustration, especially of recent in light of the Israel-Palestine conflict \u2026 it\u2019s a deeply emotional thing, deeply personal,\u201d said Jade Gray, the co-president of the group. \u201cAnd I do think that the steps that he\u2019s taken are along the path to a cease-fire, and I know that that\u2019s what folks are looking for next.\u201d\n\nNate Aurbach, another member of the organization, believes young voters will come out in support more for Biden as the election approaches, confronted by the realities of another Trump term.",

The Mexican actress, who starred in the last two installments of the horror picture franchise, was terminated from the film after controversial social media posts she shared regarding the Israel-Gaza conflict.\n\nIn a statement posted to Instagram on Wednesday, Barrera said she plans to \u201ccontinue to speak out for those that need it most and continue to advocate for peace and safety, for human rights and freedom.\u201d\n\n\u201cSilence is not an option for me,\u201d Barrera added.\n\nOn Tuesday, Spyglass Media announced that Barrera would not star in \u201cScream VII\u201d because of social media posts deemed antisemitic by the production company.\n\n\u201cWe have zero tolerance for antisemitism or the incitement of hate in any form, including false references to genocide, ethnic cleansing, Holocaust distortion or anything that flagrantly crosses the line into hate speech,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSkip to end of carousel The Style section Style is where The Washington Post covers happenings on the front lines of culture and what it all means, including the arts, media, social trends, politics and yes, fashion, all told with personality and deep reporting. For more Style stories, click here End of carousel\n\nBarrera had been vocal in her support for the Palestinian territories since last month, frequently sharing social media posts from other accounts decrying Israel\u2019s attacks on Gaza, as well as sharing her thoughts on the conflict. Barrera was also one of more than 200 entertainers who signed an open letter to President Biden in October petitioning for a cease-fire.\n\nIn her posts, Barrera has described Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza as \u201cgenocide\u201d and \u201cethnic cleansing.\u201d\n\n\u201cGaza is currently being treated like a concentration camp,\u201d she wrote in one recent post.\n\nSpyglass had yet to formally announce the cast of \u201cScream VII,\u201d but it was widely expected that Barrera, who starred in 2022\u2019s \u201cScream\u201d and this year\u2019s \u201cScream V,\u201d would return. Also this week, Hollywood trade publications announced that Barrera\u2019s co-star Jenna Ortega would not be reprising her role in the franchise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Barrera\u2019s fans had lobbied online for Ortega to walk away from the film in a show of solidarity, Deadline reported that the actress\u2019s exit was discussed before the actors strike, which began in July.\n\nShare this article Share\n\nAccording to Variety, Ortega left because of conflicts with the shooting schedule for the second season of her Netflix series \u201cWednesday,\u201d and it was unrelated to Barrera\u2019s firing.\n\nNow the franchise will move forward without the two actors credited with revitalizing it.\n\nOpinions and feelings about the Israel-Gaza war have caused some fractures in the entertainment industry, and some stars and power brokers have met with professional consequences for their comments.\n\nOscar-winning actress Susan Sarandon was reportedly dropped by United Talent Agency after comments she made at a pro-Palestinian rally in New York on Nov. 17, according to the Hollywood Reporter.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people afraid of being Jewish at this time and are getting a taste of what it feels like to be a Muslim in this country, so often subjected to violence,\u201d Sarandon said at the rally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaha Dakhil, who heads film at Hollywood agency CAA, resigned from the company\u2019s board in October after sharing an Instagram post that stated, \u201cWhat\u2019s more heartbreaking than witnessing genocide? Witnessing the denial that genocide is happening.\u201d\n\nDakhil\u2019s comments drew sharp backlash, including from screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, who announced he was dropping her as an agent after her comments. \u201cMaha isn\u2019t an antisemite, she\u2019s just wrong,\u201d Sorkin said in a statement to Variety.\n\nIn her Instagram remarks Wednesday, Barrera condemned \u201cany hate and prejudice of any kind against any group of people.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a latina, a proud Mexicana, I feel the responsibility of having a platform that allows me the privilege of being heard, and therefore I have tried to use it to raise awareness about issues I care about and to lend my voice to those in need,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cI believe a group of people are NOT their leadership, and that no governing body should be above criticism,\u201d Barrera added. She continued sharing posts from pro-Palestinian accounts afterward.",

          "text": "Beyonce gave the Beyhive something to be thankful for on Thanksgiving morning (Nov. 23): a new and final trailer for her upcoming concert documentary, Renaissance: A Film by Beyonce.\n\nThe two-minute teaser kicks off with a sideways home video before Queen Bey reveals who the cameraperson is when she addresses them: \u201cRumi, now can I teach you a trick?

[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nmeribah knight\n\nYeah. Right. And so you were \u2014 how old were you?\n\nspeaker 1 Seven.\n\nmeribah knight\n\nOh, my god. When Brandon was just seven years old, police showed up at his door to arrest him. Brandon\u2019s offense? Tagging along with his older brothers who\u2019d wrestled in a vacant duplex and left some holes in the drywall. Now police were there to take Brandon and his brothers to the juvenile detention center, jail, basically.\n\nspeaker 1 My mom said that they weren\u2019t going to take me in. But they were like, well, he needs to learn his lesson.\n\nmeribah knight\n\nBrandon was held in detention overnight and then brought to the juvenile court for his hearing.\n\nspeaker 1 They had me in shackles, from our feet to our arms, going into court.\n\nmeribah knight\n\nBrandon should have gone home with his mom that day. But when he went before the judge, she sent him back to jail for a week. Brandon\u2019s arrest and detention happened in Rutherford County, Tennessee. And his case wasn\u2019t unique there. For over a decade, the county was arresting and jailing kids for even the most minor offenses.\n\nspeaker 2 I didn\u2019t want to go to school. speaker 3 I just ran away. speaker 4 I spray painted a penis on a wall.\n\nmeribah knight\n\nIt happened so often, to so many kids in Rutherford County, that getting sent to juvenile detention was almost a rite of passage. In many cases, what it also was was illegal. This is the story of how that system came to be, how it came to be normalized, accepted, lauded even. It\u2019s also the story of two insiders who actually did see the problem in Rutherford County.\n\nspeaker 5 We would sit out, and smoke a cigarette, and say, we\u2019re going to burn this place to the ground. [LAUGHS]\n\nmeribah knight\n\nThey just needed other people to see it, too. From Serial Productions and the New York Times, I\u2019m Meribah Knight. And this is The Kids of Rutherford County, coming October 26.",
