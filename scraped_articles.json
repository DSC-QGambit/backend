[MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nmeribah knight\n\nYeah. Right. And so you were \u2014 how old were you?\n\nspeaker 1 Seven.\n\nmeribah knight\n\nOh, my god. When Brandon was just seven years old, police showed up at his door to arrest him. Brandon\u2019s offense? Tagging along with his older brothers who\u2019d wrestled in a vacant duplex and left some holes in the drywall. Now police were there to take Brandon and his brothers to the juvenile detention center, jail, basically.\n\nspeaker 1 My mom said that they weren\u2019t going to take me in. But they were like, well, he needs to learn his lesson.\n\nmeribah knight\n\nBrandon was held in detention overnight and then brought to the juvenile court for his hearing.\n\nspeaker 1 They had me in shackles, from our feet to our arms, going into court.\n\nmeribah knight\n\nBrandon should have gone home with his mom that day. But when he went before the judge, she sent him back to jail for a week. Brandon\u2019s arrest and detention happened in Rutherford County, Tennessee. And his case wasn\u2019t unique there. For over a decade, the county was arresting and jailing kids for even the most minor offenses.\n\nspeaker 2 I didn\u2019t want to go to school. speaker 3 I just ran away. speaker 4 I spray painted a penis on a wall.\n\nmeribah knight\n\nIt happened so often, to so many kids in Rutherford County, that getting sent to juvenile detention was almost a rite of passage. In many cases, what it also was was illegal. This is the story of how that system came to be, how it came to be normalized, accepted, lauded even. It\u2019s also the story of two insiders who actually did see the problem in Rutherford County.\n\nspeaker 5 We would sit out, and smoke a cigarette, and say, we\u2019re going to burn this place to the ground. [LAUGHS]\n\nmeribah knight\n\nThey just needed other people to see it, too. From Serial Productions and the New York Times, I\u2019m Meribah Knight.

Don\u2019t be scared! Contrary to popular belief, the crossword is not a competition over how much trivia one knows. Yes, random facts and knowledge will come in handy when you\u2019re filling out the crossword grid, but believe in yourself.\n\nWhen attacking the grid head-on, take a few tries to figure out your style of solving. Jackie likes to go around the grid and fill in what she knows. Then she\u2019ll continue to go back through and see if her memory has been prompted by any letters that were filled in or if an answer has \u201cjust come\u201d to her the second or third time around. Isaac likes to start with easier clue types, like fill-in-the-blanks or abbreviations.\n\nRachel Fabi, a Wordplay columnist, takes a different approach. \u201cI start every puzzle the same way: I start in the northwest and work my way through,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it\u2019ll be going back and forth between across and downs in the corner and then building off of what you have, until you have the whole thing.\u201d\n\nHave you gotten as far as you can? Try using autocheck to make sure your answers are correct. Do you need to adjust anything? Go ahead. If you\u2019re still stuck, check out Wordplay, your new best friend. Wordplay is a daily column written by Games editors that explains tricky clues, answers and more about the New York Times Crossword. That one word Rachel, Deb Amlen or Caitlin Lovinger provides there may be the key you need to unlock the rest of your puzzle.

          "text": "The regular season is over. The postseason is over. The real season is here.\n\nPerhaps \u201coffseason\u201d was apt earlier in baseball history. Now, the offseason is as fun as any other time in the baseball calendar. Be honest: Do you actually play the games in The Show or OOTP? Or do you sim the season \u2014 with a break for late July, of course \u2014 just to get to the fun part of building a new roster?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is your landing page for the 2023-24 MLB offseason. It\u2019s our Free Agent Big Board, comprised of our top 40 rankings (a composite of individual rankings by Keith Law, Tim Britton, Aaron Gleeman, Eno Sarris and Jim Bowden), stats breakdowns, contract projections, best fits and more. And whenever any player signs, check back here for instant analysis \u2014 how the fit works for the player and the team \u2014 all offseason long.\n\nWhile this isn\u2019t the deepest free-agent class, it makes up for it with star power and intrigue. Shohei Ohtani should break records for overall guarantee and/or average annual value in his next contract. Yoshinobu Yamamoto might be the best pitcher to ever move from Nippon Professional Baseball in Japan to the major leagues. Aaron Nola has been one of the sport\u2019s best and most durable starters for a half-decade and Cody Bellinger is one of its streakiest talents.\n\nAnd the number of teams looking to make an offseason statement is higher than ever. Teams accustomed to spending big (and often winning big) had down seasons in 2023 in New York (both the Bronx and Queens), Boston, St. Louis and San Francisco. The Dodgers saved up for this offseason with a quiet winter last year and are coming off another playoff disappointment.\n\nBecause here\u2019s the thing: Free agency really matters in baseball. The Rangers just spent October hammering home how successful, not to mention how fun, the return on major free-agent investment can be.\n\nSome bookkeeping: The player\u2019s listed age is how old he\u2019ll be on June 30 of next season (and thus what age he\u2019s considered for the full season), the stats are from the 2023 season, the WAR is from FanGraphs, the best fits are alphabetical and you can filter through by position or search by name.\n\nBookmark, star, Ctrl/Cmd+D depending on your preference, and check back in all winter. In the offseason, this page is always on.\n\nPosition 1B 2B 3B C CF COF DH LHP RHP RP SP SS Loading Try changing or resetting your filters to see more. 1 Shohei Ohtani Staff rankings 1 Law 1 Britton 1 Gleeman 1 Sarris 1 Bowden Profile Age 29 Position DH, RHP,SP Last team Los Angeles Angels Innings pitched 132 ERA+ 142 HR 44 OPS+ 184 Ohtani tops this list as a dual-position unicorn, but he\u2019d also top it purely as a hitter or a pitcher despite an elbow injury that will keep him off the mound in 2024. As a hitter from 2021-23, his .964 OPS was No. 2 in MLB behind only Aaron Judge. As a pitcher during that same period, his 2.84 ERA and strikeout rate of 11.4 per nine innings each ranked third for starters with at least 400 innings. Ohtani is unlike anything MLB has ever seen, with a legit case for being a top-five hitter and a top-five pitcher, which is absolutely bonkers. In the past three seasons, he produced 26.5 fWAR \u2014 15.5 as a hitter and 11.0 as a pitcher \u2014 a mind-bending total that breaks down to roughly $70 million a year in strictly on-field value. He\u2019s all but assured of securing the largest contract in MLB history. Buckle up. Team Outlook Single Double Triple Homer Lorem ipsum...This is where the text goes Data: fWAR from FanGraphs Britton's projection 12 years, $520 million Best fits LAD, NYM, SEA, SF Staff rankings 1 Law 1 Britton 1 Gleeman 1 Sarris 1 Bowden 3 year fWAR DH RHP SP 2 Aaron Nola 7 years $172 mil Profile Age 31 Position RHP, SP Last team Philadelphia Phillies Innings pitched 193 2/3 ERA+ 96 Over the last six seasons, Nola ranks first in the sport in games started, second in innings, third in strikeouts, and 15th in FIP (among pitchers with 100 starts). He has pitched at close to an ace level over that time, and he has been available all of that time. His last missed start due to injury was in May 2017. The rub for Nola is that, in two of the last three seasons, his ERA has been worse than the league average. When he struggled in 2021, Nola\u2019s peripheral stats suggested a bounceback was coming; he complied in 2022 to earn a fourth-place finish in the National League Cy Young Award voting. His peripherals aren\u2019t as rosy this year as they were then, although they are still better than league average. His strikeout rate is down a bit, and his walk rate moved back up after a career best last season. He served up a career-high 32 home runs in 2023. Player Outlook Single Double Triple Homer This is a no-brainer for Nola, who stays with the team that drafted him in 2014 and gets roughly $25 million per year through age 37 despite coming off a 4.46 ERA season. Seven years is the longest deal for a free-agent pitcher since Gerrit Cole and Stephen Strasburg in the 2019-2020 offseason, and Jacob deGrom (five years and $185 million last offseason) is the only free-agent starter to sign for more total money since then. \u2014 Aaron Gleeman Team Outlook Single Double Triple Homer Dave Dombrowski doesn\u2019t mess around. Contracts this big aren\u2019t normally signed this early in free agency, but Dombrowski doesn\u2019t care about normal when it comes to adding and keeping stars. Nola is now the Phillies\u2019 seventh player with an average annual salary of at least $20 million, joining Trea Turner, Bryce Harper, Zack Wheeler, J.T. Realmuto, Nick Castellanos and Kyle Schwarber. The Athletic'sTim Britton had projected a six-year, $180 million deal.\u2014 Aaron Gleeman Data: fWAR from FanGraphs Contract Details 7 years, $172 mil Staff rankings 3 Law 3 Britton 2 Gleeman 2 Sarris 4 Bowden 3 year fWAR RHP SP 3 Yoshinobu Yamamoto Staff rankings 4 Law 2 Britton 3 Gleeman 4 Sarris 2 Bowden Profile Age 25 Position RHP, SP Last team Orix Buffaloes (NPB) Innings pitched 171 ERA+ NPB Yamamoto will be the most prized pitcher on the open market for two reasons. First, he\u2019s posted better results in Nippon Professional Baseball than any pitcher who\u2019s ever signed in the majors. Second, he\u2019s only 25, making him an appealing option for teams that are both looking to win right away in 2024 and toward a sustained window of competitiveness beyond next year. Yamamoto has won the last three Eiji Sawamura awards \u2014 Japan\u2019s version of the Cy Young Award \u2014 and twice been named the Pacific League\u2019s most valuable player. Yamamoto works with a fastball that sits in the mid-90s and touches higher. His best secondary pitch is a splitter that dives off the table, and he utilizes an unorthodox grip on a tight curveball. Yamamoto has struck out opposing hitters about 50 percent more than the league average in Japan. A team signing Yamamoto will be subjected to a posting fee, paying 20 percent of the first $25 million, 17.5 percent of the next $25 million, and 15 percent of anything over $50 million. Photo: MLB Photos / Stringer Data: fWAR from FanGraphs Britton's projection 7 years, $203 million Best fits BOS, NYM, NYY, SF Staff rankings 4 Law 2 Britton 3 Gleeman 4 Sarris 2 Bowden 3 year fWAR RHP SP 4 Cody Bellinger Staff rankings 2 Law 4 Britton 5 Gleeman 5 Sarris 6 Bowden Profile Age 28 Position CF, 1B Last team Chicago Cubs HR 26 OPS+ 133 The only words that glide off a GM\u2019s mouth smoother than \u201crisk/reward\u201d are \u201csustainability\u201d and \u201copportunistic.\u201d So here is Bellinger, as risky a big-time reward as free agency has presented in some time. After a pair of bewilderingly poor seasons, Bellinger returned to being one of the game\u2019s premier players in 2023 on a pillow contract with the Cubs. He was the linchpin to an improved Chicago offense, propelling it into contention during one otherworldly stretch this summer and overall posting his best numbers since his MVP campaign in 2019 while patrolling center field most of the time. Bellinger is still only entering his age-28 season, and his ceiling is as a superstar capable of pairing top-flight offense with standout defense at a premium position. There\u2019s no other position player available in this market that can claim that. Bellinger has also shown a lower floor than most any free agent who\u2019s signed for the kind of deal he may land this winter, and his batted-ball data suggested his offensive results last season may have outpaced his input. Data: fWAR from FanGraphs Britton's projection 6 years, $162 million Best fits BOS, CHC, NYY, SF Staff rankings 2 Law 4 Britton 5 Gleeman 5 Sarris 6 Bowden 3 year fWAR CF 1B 5 Blake Snell Staff rankings 7 Law 5 Britton 4 Gleeman 3 Sarris 5 Bowden Profile Age 31 Position LHP, SP Last team San Diego Padres Innings pitched 180 ERA+ 182 Few pitchers have hit free agency coming off as dominant a stretch as Snell put together in his walk year: From the end of May on, he compiled a 1.20 ERA over 23 starts, blanking the opposition in 11 of those outings (and only twice allowing more than two runs). He is likely to claim his second Cy Young Award later this month and thus become just the seventh pitcher to win the award in both leagues. But \u201cwalk year\u201d was an apt way of describing Snell\u2019s season in multiple ways. He posted those remarkable results while also leading the league in walks; the last Cy Young Award winner to do that was Early Wynn in 1959. Because he goes to so many full counts, Snell rarely works beyond the sixth inning and averaged fewer than 5 2/3 innings per start this season. Data: fWAR from FanGraphs Britton's projection 5 years, $135 million Best fits LAD, SF, STL, TEX Staff rankings 7 Law 5 Britton 4 Gleeman 3 Sarris 5 Bowden 3 year fWAR LHP SP 6 Jordan Montgomery Staff rankings 6 Law 6 Britton 7 Gleeman 7 Sarris 3 Bowden Profile Age 31 Position LHP, SP Last team Texas Rangers Innings pitched 188 2/3 ERA+ 138 Montgomery\u2019s raw stuff doesn\u2019t excite and he was traded in back-to-back seasons, but he\u2019s quietly been one of MLB\u2019s most effective and durable starters since 2021. Getting ground balls with his sinker, and whiffs with curveballs and changeups, he joined Gerrit Cole and Kevin Gausman as the only pitchers with 30-plus starts and a sub-4.00 ERA in each of the past three seasons. Like most southpaws, Montgomery is death on left-handed hitters, but he also uses good command and two quality off-speed pitches to neutralize righties. It\u2019s not the sexiest profile for a pitcher set to cash in big at age 31, but Montgomery is a quality second or third option in a contending rotation and figures to be a lot of teams\u2019 top fallback plan in a relatively shallow market for starters. Data: fWAR from FanGraphs Britton's projection 5 years, $105 million Best fits BOS, LAD, NYM, TEX Staff rankings 6 Law 6 Britton 7 Gleeman 7 Sarris 3 Bowden 3 year fWAR LHP SP 7 Sonny Gray Staff rankings 5 Law 7 Britton 6 Gleeman 10 Sarris 10 Bowden Profile Age 34 Position RHP, SP Last team Minnesota Twins Innings pitched 184 ERA+ 154 Sick of nagging injuries limiting his workloads in otherwise strong seasons, Gray retooled his offseason routine at age 33 and posted his best ERA (2.79) in his most innings (184) since 2015. Gerrit Cole was the only pitcher in either league to throw more innings with a lower ERA, and Gray has a 3.22 ERA in 124 total starts since leaving the Yankees after 2018. Much of his 2023 success can be traced to allowing just eight homers, a rate of 0.4 per nine innings that led MLB and was roughly half of his career rate. He deserves credit for that, but it\u2019s also not sustainable. Any team signing Gray can expect more homers, and shouldn\u2019t bank on getting more than 400 or so innings on a three-year deal, but he\u2019s an established playoff-caliber starter with a deep pitch mix. Data: fWAR from FanGraphs Britton's projection 3 years, $72 million Best fits ATL, CIN, MIN, TEX Staff rankings 5 Law 7 Britton 6 Gleeman 10 Sarris 10 Bowden 3 year fWAR RHP SP 8 Matt Chapman Staff rankings 9 Law 9 Britton 9 Gleeman 6 Sarris 7 Bowden Profile Age 31 Position 3B Last team Toronto Blue Jays HR 17 OPS+ 108 Chapman\u2019s overall 2023 numbers are largely in line with career norms, but he got there in an odd, worrisome way. He had a monster April, hitting .384 with a 1.152 OPS. But then after May 1, he batted .205 with a .659 OPS in 113 games, including a sub-.650 OPS in four of the last five months. Soon to be 31, and with his last .800 OPS season in 2020, it\u2019s fair to wonder if his days of being an impact bat are over. His fielding remains elite, combining exceptional range with the arm strength and aggression to get outs on plays other third basemen wouldn\u2019t even attempt. Suitors offering Chapman big long-term deals will need to feel certain his defense will age gracefully. If it does, even being an average-ish hitter with 20-homer power would make him an All-Star-caliber all-around player. Data: fWAR from FanGraphs Britton's projection 5 years, $95 million Best fits ARZ, CHC, DET, TOR Staff rankings 9 Law 9 Britton 9 Gleeman 6 Sarris 7 Bowden 3 year fWAR 3B 9 Eduardo Rodr\u00edguez Staff rankings 8 Law 11 Britton 8 Gleeman 12 Sarris 11 Bowden Profile Age 31 Position LHP, SP Last team Detroit Tigers Innings pitched 152 2/3 ERA+ 134 Two offseasons ago, Rodriguez snagged a five-year, $77 million contract from the Tigers that included an opt-out after the second year. And despite personal reasons and injuries limiting him to 17 and 26 starts, opting out became a no-brainer for the 31-year-old lefty after posting a 3.58 ERA with Detroit. He should have little issue surpassing the three years and $49 million left on his original deal. Rodriguez sets batters up with his fastball and cutter, and puts them away with his trusty changeup, which allows him to neutralize righty bats better than most lefties. His lack of durability, time away from the Tigers in 2022 and headline-making veto of a midseason trade to the Dodgers could suppress Rodriguez\u2019s market somewhat, but he\u2019s a playoff-caliber lefty in a weaker free-agent starter class than last time. Data: fWAR from FanGraphs Britton's projection 5 years, $80 million Best fits ARZ, BOS, DET, MIN Staff rankings 8 Law 11 Britton 8 Gleeman 12 Sarris 11 Bowden 3 year fWAR LHP SP 10 Josh Hader Staff rankings 23 Law 8 Britton 10 Gleeman 8 Sarris 8 Bowden Profile Age 30 Position LHP, RP Last team San Diego Padres Innings pitched 56 1/3 ERA+ 321 For two months of the 2022 season, one of the game\u2019s most dominant closers broke. Over his last month as a Brewer and first as a Padre, Hader allowed 25 runs in 15 innings. Remove that stretch from his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and Hader owns a 1.96 ERA over the past six seasons, a stretch of remarkable dominance. Yes, his strikeout rate is down from the ridiculous high-40s rates he ran back in 2018 and 2019 to merely one of the top five in the sport, and his walk rate in 2023 was a new career worst. Under the hood, there are some reasons to be concerned that Hader can be as good as he has been, broadly, up to this point. But how many relievers would you trust more in a ninth inning right now than Hader? You\u2019re probably not counting on a second hand, and you may not be using all the fingers on the first. Data: fWAR from FanGraphs Britton's projection 4 years, $80 million Best fits LAD, PHI, STL, TEX Staff rankings 23 Law 8 Britton 10 Gleeman 8 Sarris 8 Bowden 3 year fWAR LHP RP 11 Marcus Stroman Staff rankings 11 Law 14 Britton 11 Gleeman 13 Sarris 14 Bowden Profile Age 33 Position RHP, SP Last team Chicago Cubs Innings pitched 136 2/3 ERA+ 113 On June 20, Stroman\u2019s 2.28 ERA led the National League, and he was a frontrunner for the Cy Young award. He\u2019d make only nine starts after that point, and he\u2019d post an even 9.00 ERA in those starts. A lot of that can probably be attributed to first a hip and then a rib-cage injury that knocked Stroman out of action for six weeks and meant an initial return to the bullpen in September as he built back up. However, it\u2019s the second straight season in which injuries have limited Stroman to fewer than 140 innings total, and his performance when on the field has been a step back from what it was during his best years with the Blue Jays and Mets. His walk rate in 2023 was a career high. Still, as long as he\u2019s healthy, Stroman should pitch in the top half of a rotation. Data: fWAR from FanGraphs Britton's projection 3 years, $63 million Best fits BOS, KC, LAA, PHI Staff rankings 11 Law 14 Britton 11 Gleeman 13 Sarris 14 Bowden 3 year fWAR RHP SP 12 Shota Imanaga Staff rankings 12 Law 21 Britton 14 Gleeman 11 Sarris 22 Bowden Profile Age 30 Position LHP, SP Last team Yokohama DeNA BayStars (NPB) Innings pitched 159 ERA+ NPB While Yoshinobu Yamamoto has stolen most of the headlines, Imanaga had his own breakout earlier this year in the World Baseball Classic. He\u2019s the left-hander who started the championship game against the United States. In three appearances in the WBC, Imanaga allowed two runs in six innings, striking out seven. Imanaga was not quite as dominant in 2023 as he had been in 2022; nevertheless, over the past three seasons his ERA in NPB has been about 38 percent better than the league average there. That\u2019s in line with pitchers like Hiroki Kuroda and Hisashi Iwakuma before they signed in the majors. A team signing Imanaga will be subjected to a posting fee, paying 20 percent of the first $25 million, 17.5 percent of the next $25 million, and 15 percent of anything over $50 million.

Until that point, Hoskins had been a steady and productive presence in the middle of the Philadelphia order, consistently posting an OPS+ around 125 and approaching 30 homers each season. The knee injury creates some questions, but maybe fewer than it would if Hoskins were expected to patrol, say, center field. He should still be able to play first base, and in a bad free-agent market for position players, he\u2019s a guy who can fit a lot of different rosters \u2014 contending teams in need of a middle-of-the-order bat, teams coming up that could use a veteran presence, rebuilding teams looking to flip someone at the deadline for prospects. That could include a return to the Phillies, depending on where they want to play Bryce Harper long-term.

As they did with Kyle Schwarber before, the Nationals turned a one-year deal with Candelario into on-field production and a mid-season trade. Candelario hopes that translates into a similar multiyear payday. While the primary statistics were right in line or better with his production in 2021 or the abbreviated 2020 season, Candelario\u2019s underlying metrics were a little less positive this time around. Still, that\u2019s three seasons in the past four he\u2019s delivered solid if not quite spectacular results while playing a decent third base. For a team with a need on either corner of the infield, Candelario is a strong option behind Matt Chapman.

Giolito still missed plenty of bats, but he served up a whopping 41 homers in 184 1/3 innings. At age 29, he\u2019s one of the most obvious rebound candidates among prominent free agents. Giolito received Cy Young Award votes in 2019, 2020 and 2021, and his strikeout and walk rates have slipped only slightly since then. But any team willing to spend big money on Giolito for multiple years must be sure his once-excellent changeup is still a potential weapon rather than just part of the homer-allowing problem.

A team signing Lee will be subjected to a posting fee, paying 20 percent of the first $25 million, 17.5 percent of the next $25 million, and 15 percent of anything over $50 million.

The usual prime years of 27 through 29, though, were rough on Wacha. He was well below league average in all three, on the cusp of washing out of major-league rotations entirely. After altering his repertoire as a Ray in 2021, Wacha has seen significantly better results over the past two seasons with Boston and San Diego. He\u2019s gone 25-6 in that time, throwing about 130 innings each season with an ERA 27 percent better than the league average. Wacha has pitched for five different teams over the past five years.

Given that chance with the Padres, he justified all of it. He threw nearly as many innings in 2023 as he had in the previous three combined, and he did so at a 3.57 ERA. Lugo\u2019s carrying pitch has always been his curveball, an early Statcast darling because of its absurd spin rate. But he owns a broad mix that included a slider he was working on as last season progressed. Lugo\u2019s relative lack of innings leading into 2023 can be looked at as a positive (his arm is far fresher than most guys at 34) or a negative (how does his arm recover from the increased workload). In a market with a lot of similar veteran arms, Lugo stands out for his unique upside at 34.

He\u2019s hit as many as 48 long balls in a season, and he\u2019s averaged a home run every 20 plate appearances over the past three seasons. The power is no fluke: Soler hits the ball as hard as most anyone in the sport, and as often. The downsides are just as clear. He played just 89 games in the outfield over the past two seasons for Miami, and he didn\u2019t play it well. He\u2019s vulnerable to extended cold streaks in which he strikes out about 30 percent of the time.

Hern\u00e1ndez has an MLB-leading .626 slugging percentage versus lefties since 2020, hitting .312 with 32 homers in 414 at-bats. During that time, Aaron Judge and Paul Goldschmidt are the only other regulars to slug over .600 against lefties.

Gurriel\u2019s strengths are in putting the ball in play and punishing sliders. He swings a lot but misses less than most, thanks to his ability to put the bat on the ball.

But his right-handed power and plate discipline make an undeniable impact whenever, and wherever, he\u2019s in the lineup. His combined .826 OPS since 2021 is 19th among right-handed hitters, sandwiched between Xander Bogaerts and Nolan Arenado. Garver started just 41 games behind the plate in two seasons with Texas, including only one start there after Sept. 1 last season. That suggests he should be seen as a designated hitter who can occasionally catch, but a healthy Garver is good enough to make a big impact in a bat-first role.

Yeah, still pretty good. The big question around Kershaw, of course, is the health of his left shoulder. He looked diminished over the final seven weeks of the regular season as a five-and-dive starter and like a shell of himself when getting hammered in the Division Series. He underwent surgery on that shoulder last week, saying only that he was hopeful of playing sometime in the summer.

Even while thriving in the second half, Maeda\u2019s average fastball was barely above 90 mph, but he\u2019s never relied on big-time velocity and his splitter-slider off-speed combo continues to baffle hitters. Counting on Maeda for more than 125 innings is probably a mistake at this point, and he can\u2019t afford to lose any more oomph on his fastball.

His production slipped slightly in the second half, but Turner has gas left in the tank based on his ability to control the strike zone by rarely chasing and making consistent, solid contact when he swings. There\u2019s always a lot of competition in the first baseman/designated hitter pool, and Turner will almost surely have to settle for a one-year contract given his age, but he should be a popular target for contending teams looking to boost the lineup without having to make a long-term commitment.

Stephenson had a 4.91 career ERA before the deal. Tampa Bay tweaked Stephenson\u2019s oft-used slider into a more cutter-like offering he threw nearly 70 percent of the time, with amazing results.

Seasons like Pham\u2019s for a 35-year-old are more often dead-cat bounces than full-on revivals. Pham, however, could argue that a late-spring change in contact lenses was a primary driver of his on-field improvement and thus a reason it can be sustained. (He has keratoconus, an eye condition that can blur vision.) A year after his strikeout rate spiked and his walk rate plunged, Pham brought both back closer to his career norms.

It was a shocking collapse for a 30-year-old coming off four straight seasons hitting above .300. Anderson\u2019s value has always revolved around batting average, because he swings at everything and has middling power, which makes last season\u2019s jump in strikeout rate especially worrisome.

Last season\u2019s 88.6 mph average fastball velocity was one of the lowest among all starters, but even at his best (and healthiest) Ryu barely threw over 90.

Over the last two years with the Dodgers and Phillies, he has reasserted himself as, if not one of the game\u2019s most historically dominant closers, at least a capable closer for a winning team. Kimbrel\u2019s gotten back to himself by reining in a walk rate that had climbed to untenable heights. (It\u2019s still not ideal.) He needs to be able to command his fastball in the zone to generate chase with his all-world curveball. At 36, he\u2019s probably back in the market for another one-year deal, again appealing to good teams with a high-leverage need late.

Not bad for a guy released by the Cubs entering what would have been the final year of his eight-year contract with the club. Heyward has long been known for his defense and his leadership. He\u2019s a useful player when his offense is right around league average, let alone above it the way it was in 2023. Even as he\u2019ll be 34 next season, he can do more than stand in center field and he remains a very good defender in the corners.

It may seem like he should still be in the middle of his peak, but Merrifield was a late bloomer, debuting for the Royals at age 27. Now he\u2019s 35 and hasn\u2019t posted an OPS above league average since 2020, with declining speed and fielding flexibility. He\u2019s still fast, but Merrifield\u2019s sprint speed has dropped from the 94th percentile to the 85th percentile. He led the league by going 40-for-44 on steals in 2021, but he\u2019s 42-for-57 in 284 games since, in part because he\u2019s no longer as able to get on base. Merrifield remains a high-end role player capable of manning second base and all three outfield spots, but he\u2019s no longer an everyday, top-of-the-lineup asset.

He looked poised to play a significant role down the stretch for the defending pennant-winners in the National League, and then cash in this winter having proven his bona fides as a starter. Instead, he made just five more starts for Philadelphia, with an ERA approaching eight across them, and got shifted to the pen for the rest of September and October. Since shifting back to the rotation in 2022, Lorenzen\u2019s ERA is a hair better than league average, with a strikeout rate well below. He did really improve his walk rate and the effectiveness of the fastball, which is to say there are tools here for a pitcher with less wear on his arm than most at 32.

          "title": "Israel-Hamas War Israel and Hamas Agree to Cease-Fire for Release of Hostages",
          "text": "Faces of hostages projected on a wall in the Old City of Jerusalem this month.\n\nThe Israeli government and Hamas agreed to a brief cease-fire in Gaza to allow for the release of 50 hostages captured during Hamas\u2019s assault last month on Israel and the release of 150 Palestinian prisoners held in Israel, Qatar said early Wednesday.\n\nThe cease-fire\u2019s start will be announced within the next 24 hours, and it will last for at least four days, said the government of Qatar, which helped lead the negotiations. It added that the pause in fighting would also allow for more aid and fuel to reach civilians in Gaza.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office announced its approval of the deal in a WhatsApp message early Wednesday. If the multiday pause holds, it would be the longest halt in hostilities since Hamas\u2019s Oct. 7 attacks prompted Israel to begin its bombardment and subsequent ground invasion of Gaza.\n\nMr. Netanyahu\u2019s office said women and children would be among the hostages released and that \u201cthe release of every 10 additional hostages will result in an additional day in the pause.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Israeli government is committed to bringing all the hostages home,\u201d the government added.\n\nLess than an hour later, Hamas said in a statement on Telegram that it too had agreed to the deal.\n\n\u201cAfter many days of difficult and complex negotiations, we announce, with the help and blessing of God, that we have reached a humanitarian truce,\u201d the Hamas statement read.\n\nImage A wounded child at Nasser Medical Hospital in Khan Younis in the south of the Gaza Strip on Tuesday. Credit... Yousef Masoud for The New York Times\n\nHostages probably will not be released until Thursday at the earliest, to allow time for Israeli judges to review potential legal challenges to the prisoner release, according to Israeli officials.\n\nMohammed Al Khulaifi, a Qatari state minister who was a main negotiator on the talks, urged both sides to meet their obligations under the agreement and said he hoped it would pave the way for an end to the war.\n\n\u201cThis agreement is the first time both sides have agreed to support the diplomatic track over continued fighting, which has inflicted so much pain and suffering on innocent civilians,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nUntil the cease-fire begins, the situation is likely to remain fluid. Hamas added in its statement that while it had agreed to a truce, \u201cour hands will remain on the trigger,\u201d and its fighters \u201cwill remain on the lookout to defend our people and to defeat the occupation and aggression.\u201d\n\nHamas and its allies in Gaza captured about 240 hostages during their raid on southern Israel on Oct. 7, which also killed an estimated 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials. Israel has responded with thousands of airstrikes and by invading Gaza with ground forces, killing more than 12,000 people in the fighting, according to health officials in the Hamas-controlled territory.\n\nHamas said in its statement that Israel had also agreed to let in more aid supplies to Gaza, continue to allow civilians to evacuate northern Gaza and halt its flights over Gaza except for a six-hour window every day.\n\nIsrael and Hamas have been negotiating indirectly for weeks over the hostages. A deal had seemed within reach on a few occasions, only for the negotiations to stall or fall apart.\n\nVideo Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Tuesday called for the government to back a hostage deal, while saying that he will continue the war on Hamas. Credit Credit... Pool photo by Abir Sultan\n\nThe Israeli government has vowed to destroy Hamas, but it has also come under domestic pressure to free the hostages. A brief cease-fire could allow Israel to achieve part of the latter objective before returning to the former.\n\nMr. Netanyahu said on Tuesday, before the deal was announced, that Israel\u2019s campaign to prevent Hamas from controlling any part of Gaza would continue after the cease-fire.\n\n\u201cWe are at war, and we\u2019ll continue this war until we meet all our objectives,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said.\n\nA pause in the fighting, however brief, could bring some measure of relief to Palestinian civilians in Gaza. More than one million Gazans have been displaced, and civilians are running perilously low on basic necessities like food and water. As part of its offensive against Hamas, Israel has cut off electricity to Gaza and blocked the delivery of most fuel, saying it could be diverted for the armed group\u2019s use.\n\nEdward Wong , Aaron Boxerman , Liam Stack , Johnatan Reiss and Maria Abi-Habib contributed reporting.",

          "title": "Political Pressures on Biden Helped Drive \u2018Secret Cell\u2019 of Aides in Hostage Talks",
          "text": "Aides said the president was also hopeful that the hostage release could be an early step toward a broader peace in the region once the immediate crisis ends. In an opinion article published in the Washington Post on Sunday, Mr. Biden described how far his ambitions stretch beyond the four-day pause in fighting agreed to on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cOur goal should not be simply to stop the war for today,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt should be to end the war forever, break the cycle of unceasing violence, and build something stronger in Gaza and across the Middle East so that history does not keep repeating itself.\u201d\n\nMr. Biden and his top aides have repeatedly said they do not tell Israel how to respond to the slaughter of 1,200 people inside their country, and Mr. Netanyahu made it clear on Tuesday that he intended to resume military operations against Hamas as soon as the hostages were freed in accordance with the deal.\n\n\u201cThe war will continue,\u201d Mr. Netanyahu said.\n\nBut some senior American officials have signaled they would not be disappointed if the pause became a more permanent cease-fire. If the White House tries to use the hostage deal to press for a longer-term cease-fire and start moving toward the bigger questions about occupation and a two-state solution, that could put Mr. Biden on another collision course with Mr. Netanyahu when the fighting is scheduled to resume.\n\nA top administration official, who briefed reporters on Tuesday in the hours before the deal was finalized, said the pause in fighting was a step toward an eventual push for peace. But the official cautioned that such a possibility was a long way off.\n\nThe official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a deal that had not yet been finalized.\n\nIn the short term, the president and his aides say they are focused on ensuring that Hamas lives up to the promises the militant group made during weeks of negotiations that often seemed destined to fail.\n\nThe first sign of progress came in late October, when U.S. officials received word through intermediaries in Qatar and Egypt that Hamas could accept a deal to release women and children. In return, they wanted Israel to free Palestinian prisoners, pause the fighting, and delay a ground invasion.\n\nWith Israeli troops massing outside Gaza, officials in Israel and the United States debated whether to accept the deal. Israeli officials did not think Hamas was serious about the offer and refused to delay the ground offensive. Hamas refused to provide any proof of life about the hostages. Negotiations stalled.\n\nAt the White House, Mr. Biden and his foreign policy team kept pressing. On Nov. 14, hope swelled again after Mr. Netanyahu called the president to say he could accept the latest offer from Hamas. But just hours after the call, Israeli military forces stormed Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza, which they said served as a Hamas command center. Suddenly, communications between Hamas and the officials in Qatar and Egypt went silent. When Hamas resurfaced hours later, they made it clear: The deal was off.\n\nFor several days, the militant group demanded that Israeli troops withdraw from the hospital, which Israel refused. It took several days for the talks to resume, following a call from Mr. Biden to the emir of Qatar.\n\nAdministration officials continued pressing Israel and, through the intermediaries, Hamas. After Mr. Biden\u2019s call, top aides, including the director of the C.I.A., met with the emir in Qatar to go over the latest draft \u2014 a six-page text with detailed steps for implementation on both sides.\n\nWithin a week, the diplomatic pressure paid off. On Tuesday evening, as the Israeli cabinet took its final vote to approve the deal, Mr. Biden headed out of Washington for a five-day Thanksgiving vacation with his family on the island of Nantucket.\n\nThe Israeli decision, announced by Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s office, would allow for a pause of at least four days in the fighting in Gaza. If it holds, it will be the longest halt in hostilities since Hamas\u2019s Oct. 7 attacks prompted Israel to begin its bombardment of Gaza.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday night, Mr. Biden pledged to work with regional leaders \u201cto ensure this deal is carried through in its entirety. It is important that all aspects of this deal be fully implemented.\u201d\n\nBut even with the deal in place, Mr. Biden faces challenges ahead. There are still Americans being held hostage in Gaza, and the tensions in the United States, and within his own party, show few signs of diminishing.\n\nOfficials said they were keenly aware that the horror for the families of those still in captivity in Gaza will not end until their loved ones are home.\n\nFor Mr. Biden, it could not happen soon enough.\n\n\u201cAs president, I have no higher priority than ensuring the safety of Americans held hostage around the world,\u201d Mr. Biden said in his statement, adding, \u201cToday\u2019s deal should bring home additional American hostages, and I will not stop until they are all released.\u201d",

          "text": "The deal for a hostage release brought both hope and agony on Wednesday to families of captives held in Gaza.\n\nUncertainty over the agreement \u2014 including over who would be among at least 50 hostages set to be released, and whether more would follow \u2014 was straining the emotions of relatives who have campaigned for the release of their loved ones in the 46 days since they were abducted during the Hamas assault on southern Israel.\n\nIsrael has said that about 240 people were taken hostage to Gaza, and it remained unclear which of them would be released under the cease-fire deal announced overnight. Cease-fires in previous conflicts between Israel and Hamas have proven fragile.\n\nHours after the deal was announced, families said they had received no official information from the Israeli authorities. The government said in a statement that women and children would be released, raising the possibility that families could be separated \u2014 for example, by leaving behind fathers who were taken captive with their children. At least 36 Israeli civilians ages 18 and under are being held in Gaza along with 13 of their mothers.\n\n\u201cI am feeling like yesterday and the day before, only worse,\u201d said Yael Engel Lichi, the aunt of Ofir Engel, a 12th grader from Jerusalem who was kidnapped on Oct. 7 from Kibbutz Be\u2019eri, where he was staying with his girlfriend, Yuval Sharabi, 17, and her family.\n\nPeople have been calling to congratulate the family since Tuesday night, Ms. Engel Lichi said on Wednesday morning.

          "text": "Residents of the Gaza Strip greeted the news of a temporary cease-fire with mixed emotions on Wednesday, expressing hope for a respite in Israel\u2019s relentless bombardment but concern that the brief pause did not mean an end to the war.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of relief,\u201d Ahmed Nassar, a 27-year-old taxi driver, said in a phone interview, adding that he hoped the deal would not fall through. \u201cGod willing, at midnight we will see it.\u201d\n\nThe start of the cease-fire \u2014 which would allow for the release of 50 hostages held in Gaza and 150 Palestinian prisoners held in Israel \u2014 was to be announced within 24 hours and last for at least four days, said the government of Qatar, which helped lead the negotiations. The pause in fighting would also allow the delivery of more aid and fuel for civilians in Gaza, Qatar said.\n\nMr. Nassar, who fled his northern Gaza neighborhood of Jabaliya and is now living in the central part of the strip, said the deal raised the prospect that a longer cease-fire could come in the next few weeks, which could allow his family to go back and check on their home.\n\nBut Israeli officials have signaled that the war aimed at eradicating Hamas, which rules Gaza, will go on. For now, they have said, the 1.7 million Palestinians displaced by the fighting will not be allowed to return to their homes during the pause.\n\nThe four-day pause is \u201cnot guaranteeing the end of the military operations in the Gaza Strip,\u201d said Bisan Owda, who has been documenting the war on social media. \u201cThis period is not enough to pull the dead bodies from under the rubble and bury them, to search for the missing people, to open the roads, to treat the injured.\u201d\n\nGazan health authorities say that more than 12,000 people have been killed since the start of Israel\u2019s retaliation against Hamas for the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks that killed about 1,200 people in Israel, according to Israeli officials. Most of the 1.7 million displaced people fled homes in the north of the territory and evacuated to the south following repeated Israeli orders.\n\n\u201cI want to go home,\u201d Hind Khoudary, a freelance journalist who stayed behind to document the war after her family evacuated from the strip, said on Instagram. A temporary pause \u201cwithout going home is meaningless,\u201d she added.\n\nFiras Al-Derby, 17, who is sheltering with his parents at an overcrowded United Nations-run school in the south, said he did not hear the news of the cease-fire and prisoner exchange because of spotty communication networks in Gaza. When a reporter for The New York Times told him over the phone about the agreement that was reached overnight, he sounded underwhelmed. The news meant little to his mother, Hanan, who is ill with cancer and has been unable to continue her treatment after Gaza\u2019s only cancer hospital went out of service last month.\n\n\u201cYou think my mom would be happy over a temporary cease-fire?\u201d he said. \u201cThe only thing that would make her happy now is to be able to continue her cancer treatment.\u201d\n\nThe mood at the school on Wednesday morning was not celebratory, he said, because the pause is not meant to last.\n\n\u201cThis deal is not a truce,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s resting time for the soldiers.\u201d",
