          "title": "FDA Approves Pfizer\u2019s Coronavirus Vaccine",
          "text": "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday night approved the first coronavirus vaccine for emergency use in the United States, several media outlets reported, clearing the way for U.S. officials to begin vaccinating millions of Americans as early as next week.\n\nThe New York Times wrote:\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration authorized Pfizer\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use on Friday, according to three people with knowledge of the decision who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it. The action means millions of highly vulnerable people will begin receiving the vaccine within days.\n\nThe Washington Post also confirmed the news that the FDA has approved the vaccine. The Post wrote:\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration on Friday gave emergency use authorization to the nation\u2019s first coronavirus vaccine, launching what scientists hope will be a critical counteroffensive against a pathogen that has killed more than 290,000 Americans, shredded the nation\u2019s social and political fabric and devastated the economy.\n\nThe vaccine, from Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, will reportedly be shipped out in the. millions across America over the next week. The United States joins other countries, including the United Kingdom and Canada, in approving the vaccine. The Pfizer vaccine is administered in two separate doses ,weeks apart, and American officials have been preparing, as the vaccine requires being frozen for a massive undertaking of shipping and storing the vaccine nationwide. Pfizer has said the vaccine has a 95 percent effectiveness rate, without any serious side effects.\n\nThis week, U.S. officials from President Donald Trump\u2019s administration gathered with governors at the White House to tout the coming vaccine and lay out a vision for distributing it nationwide.\n\nTrump released a video on Twitter announcing the news of the FDA\u2019s approval of the vaccine, saying it met the \u201cgold standard of safety\u201d of the world\u2019s premiere agency that gauges effectiveness and safety of medicines.\n\n\u201cI have really good news,\u201d Trump said. \u201cToday our nation has achieved a medical miracle. We have delivered a safe and effective vaccine in just nine months. This is one of the greatest scientific accomplishments in history. It will save millions of lives and end the pandemic once and for all.\u201d\n\nTrump also touted Operation Warp Speed as helping deliver this vaccine, as his administration through this program put huge funding behind the effort to develop the cure\u2014and to get it distributed out to the general public. The president said that while governors will decide how the vaccine is administered in their states, \u201cthe first vaccine will be administered in less than 24 hours.\u201d\n\nHe also said that all Americans will be able to get it for free.\n\n\u201cWe have made sure that this vaccine will be free for all Americans,\u201d Trump said.\n\nSenior officials from the Trump administration celebrated the news too.\n\n\u201cIt is nothing short of a medical miracle to have FDA authorization of a vaccine for COVID-19 just over 11 months since the virus was made known to the world,\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement. \u201cBecause of President Trump\u2019s strong leadership and unwavering support for Operation Warp Speed, we have millions of doses of this vaccine that are now being shipped to every corner of America, with administration to begin as soon as providers are ready. The triumph of Operation Warp Speed is a tribute to dedicated public servants across HHS and the Department of Defense, our partners in the private sector, and incredible American scientists. This vaccine, like any vaccine FDA potentially authorizes, has been through multiple stages of safety review, and it has shown extraordinary effectiveness in protecting people from the virus. Vaccines will help bring this pandemic to an end, which is all the more reason to double down on the public health measures we need to stay safe in the coming months. As Americans get vaccinated, we need to continue taking steps like washing our hands, social distancing, and wearing face coverings to protect ourselves, our loved ones, and our communities.\u201d\n\nActing Defense Secretary Christopher Miller, whose Department is overseeing the logistics side of vaccine distribution through Operation Warp Speed, praised servicemen and women who are leading the effort to get the vaccine out all across America.\n\n\u201cThe massive logistical planning our military has contributed to Operation Warp Speed gives me even more pride in the talent and dedication of our service members,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThey have been crucial in bringing a safe and effective vaccine to the American people and in restoring the health of our country.\u201d\n\nVaccines normally take years to develop and receive approval, but Trump\u2019s Operation Warp Speed\u2013part of the White House Coronavirus Task Force effort under the president\u2019s leadership\u2013sped up the process significantl, having one ready in less than a year since the novel coronavirus pandemic first broke out across the United States and around the world.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Breitbart News in April, FDA commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn estimated that the vaccine may take as long as a year to 18 months from then to develop and approve\u2013so this nine-month timetable is truly record-setting.\n\n\u201cOn vaccine development, as you know it takes time for vaccines,\u201d Hahn said in early April. \u201cIn record time, a company in collaboration with the FDA and U.S. government\u2014and N.I.H. was involved with this too\u2014a company has gotten a vaccine into clinical trials. That\u2019s a safety clinical trial, so the earliest\u2014we\u2019re working with a number of manufacturers, so PHARMA and vaccine manufacturers have stood up and really leaned in on this one. We are working with a number of manufacturers, and there are a number of promising candidates. We\u2019re working hard to accelerate that timetable. Typically it takes years. Dr. Fauci has mentioned on TV that it may take 12 to 18 months. I think that is a typical and reasonable timeframe. But I don\u2019t want the American people to think we\u2019re resting on a standard timetable here. We\u2019re really pushing hard to try to accelerate things here. There\u2019s a number of things we can do from a regulatory point of view and with respect to manufacturing capacity to help the clinical trials get performed so they\u2019re as efficient as possible\u2014and also around sharing of data. This is where industry where again, normally as competitors, they have committed to sharing so we can have the absolute best products in the hands of the American people and that includes vaccines.\u201d\n\nBut this process was not without its hiccups. Other countries had approved the vaccine first, before the FDA here in the United States, and the FDA\u2019s advisory committee had recommended its approval earlier this week. Several media outlets reported that White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows leaned in on Hahn Friday to ensure the FDA got final emergency approval across the finish line this week\u2013 or else he\u2019d be fired\u2013 reportedly that some at FDA pushed back on. Hahn himself said that the media reports of such a phone call were inaccurate.\n\nThe virus, which intelligence officials agree emanated from Wuhan, China, has completely upended the world and the United States for the past nine months. The FDA approval of the Pfizer vaccine, and looming potential approvals of other vaccine candidates, gives hope to an otherwise grim pandemic that has shaken the world. It also completely changed the trajectory of the 2020 presidential campaign, as Democrat candidate former Vice President Joe Biden made Trump\u2019s response to the pandemic a centerpiece of his campaign. While Trump continues to challenge the election results, Biden is currently the certified winner in well more than enough states to easily secure an electoral college victory. Next week, those electors will, barring any last-second surprises, formally be slated for Biden\u2013all while the coronavirus vaccine is administered to the first of what is expected to be millions of Americans who eventually get it\u2013capping a tumultuous year in American politics, health, and science.",

          "title": "The Supreme Court's clear message to President Trump: Stop",
          "text": "(CNN) During the past four years, President Donald Trump has challenged the integrity of the Supreme Court and tried to drag the justices into the legal muck with him.\n\nHis arguments have pushed the boundaries of the law and his assertions have tested the impartiality of individual justices. But Trump's meritless attack on the November election and his loss to Joe Biden in a brazen lawsuit initiated by the Texas attorney general brought the court into a wholly new realm.\n\nThe high court slapped down the case promoted by Trump on Friday, three days before the Electoral College will meet to cast votes for Biden as the winner of the November election, with no noted dissents.\n\nAs such, the court's justices, six of whom were appointed by Republican presidents, three by Trump, have separated themselves from the pattern of hard-core partisans who were asking the court to use baseless claims of widespread voter fraud to disenfranchise millions of voters.\n\nIf the justices had not rejected the request from Texas and other Republican-led states, they would have defied their own precedent and compromised any notion of neutrality.\n\nFor the Supreme Court itself, there has always been a question of how it emerges from Trump's legally fraught four years. Many of his policy initiatives -- and some of his personal financial dealings -- were subject to lawsuits.\n\nAnd the President routinely suggested that once a case reached the conservative-dominated bench, he would prevail. His Twitter posts and other rhetoric have constantly undermined the notion of neutral judges. He implied Democratic appointees would automatically rule against him and Republican appointees would side with him.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, a few hours before the justices' order in Texas v. Pennsylvania, Trump tweeted, \"If the Supreme Court shows Great Wisdom and Courage, the American People will win perhaps the most important case in history and our Electoral Process will be respected again!\"\n\nHe had pushed for swift Senate confirmation in October of his third appointee, Amy Coney Barrett, to succeed the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg, saying the court might end up deciding the election. (Barrett did not recuse herself from the Texas case.)\n\nBefore Trump brought the country to this point on the election, his policy agenda had bitterly divided the nine justices, such as on the travel ban that affected majority-Muslim countries and his attempt to end the \"Dreamers\" program for young immigrants who came to the US without proper papers.\n\nTrump prevailed on the first, in 2018, and lost on the second, just this year. The administration generally did better in the early years, as the court majority soon grew frustrated with the Trump team's failure to comply with procedural norms.\n\nIn opinions written by Chief Justice John Roberts, the court found that the administration contrived a rationale for a proposed citizenship question on the 2020 census and, separately, failed to justify its rollback of protections for \"Dreamers\" in the Obama-sponsored Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals , or DACA, program.\n\nBut Trump could usually count on two or more justices on the right-wing to endorse his positions.\n\nIn the election case, not a single justice expressed any openness to the Texas and Trump assertions of election irregularities. Friday night's order was unsigned.\n\nThe only other comment in the court's action may be mainly of interest to the legal community, rather than relevant to the election results. In asking the justices to exercise its \"original jurisdiction,\" Paxton tried to vault over lower courts and brush aside rulings against the President and his allies. Only Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas wrote a separate statement saying they would have given Texas permission to file the case. But they also said they would not have granted any claims.\n\nThe substance of the case aside, the sloppiness of some of filings might have generated additional frustrations for the justices. The apparent haste in which many were put together reinforced the overall weakness of the arguments. A brief from GOP states that included Louisiana spelled it \"Lousiana.\" The filing from GOP lawmakers placed Republican Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey from South Carolina instead. Advocates for the \"New California\" and \"New Nevada\" states, siding with Texas, repeatedly misspelled the name of current California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nJUST WATCHED Dale: I don't usually have to fact-check court briefs Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Dale: I don't usually have to fact-check court briefs 03:35\n\nTrump vs. The Roberts Court\n\nOver his tenure, Trump has split the high court and put Roberts on the defensive.\n\nAfter Trump derided a judge who ruled against him in November 2018 as an \"Obama judge,\" Roberts issued a statement: \"We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\"\n\nThe Roberts Court majority has sided with the President's positions more often than not, particularly on pro-corporate, anti-immigrant, and conservative religious liberty claims. But there have been recent high-profile losses, including the DACA case this year, that have drawn Trump's wrath on Twitter.\n\nThe administration may be headed for another. Based on the justices' comments during arguments over the Affordable Care Act in November, Trump may soon lose his attempt to kill Obamacare. During arguments, Roberts expressed frustration that opponents of the law that has brought health insurance coverage to 20 million more Americans had failed to end it legislatively and were asking the judicial branch to do it for them.\n\nIrrespective of whether the justices ruled for the administration or its challengers, Roberts took pains to signal the justices' independence.\n\n\"We should celebrate our strong and independent judiciary, a key source of national unity and stability,\" Roberts wrote in his 2019 year-end message. \"But we should also remember that justice is not inevitable.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Famed GOP election lawyer weighs in on Supreme Court decision Replay More Videos ...

          "title": "Trump schemes next political moves after effort to overthrow democracy dead ends at Supreme Court",
          "text": "(CNN) President Donald Trump's effort to unravel democracy hit a dead end at the Supreme Court Friday night, capping five weeks in which he dragged the country along on his narcissistic quest to stay in power after President-elect Joe Biden overwhelmingly won the election.\n\nIn the end, the guardrails of democracy stayed in place. Trump lost -- for the second time at the Supreme Court this week. But instead of helping the effort to curb a deadly pandemic that has claimed nearly 300,000 American lives by easing the transition for his successor, he is already scheming about his next political moves. Before the high court rejected his bid Friday, his campaign announced a cable ad buy to further his fraudulent claims about the election, and he clearly intends to try and meddle in Congress' counting of the Electoral College results in January.\n\nMore broadly, the damage he has done to Americans' faith and trust in democratic institutions will last long after he packs his bags and ends what will go down as one of the worst presidencies in history.\n\nWhile waiting to hear from the Supreme Court on Friday, Trump attacked another American institution, opening a new front in his war on science and ethics by pressuring the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration to rush the process for granting emergency use authorization for Pfizer and BioNTech's coronavirus vaccine. Ultimately, the FDA greenlighted the vaccine late Friday night in the time frame that was expected.\n\nIt was fitting that on a historic day -- when Americans got their first confirmation that vaccines could soon be on the way -- the President was distracted at the White House, stewing over his election defeats and tweeting lies about voting in Georgia.\n\nTrump \"put a huge stress test on our democracy,\" GOP election lawyer Ben Ginsberg said, reflecting on the destruction that the commander-in-chief has wrought by undermining US election processes and jeopardizing the safety of countless election workers as he pursued frivolous lawsuits that were scorned even by judges he appointed.\n\n\"It's five weeks after Election Day, and the institutions of our democracy held against this onslaught, and so we should be really proud of that,\" Ginsberg said to CNN's Wolf Blitzer on \"The Situation Room\" Friday evening. \"At the same time, the Republicans who did follow Donald Trump really have an obligation now to make the country strong again, to heal the chinks that Donald Trump tried to put in the foundation and the democracy.\"\n\nBut there are few signs that Trump loyalists are taking that moment of reflection in a deeply fractured Republican Party. When Trump joined Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's lawsuit, which was also joined by 19 GOP attorneys general and was attempting to invalidate the votes of millions of voters in Biden-won states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia and Wisconsin, more than 125 GOP House lawmakers also signed on, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nThey knew that the lawsuit would serve as a loyalty litmus test as Trump openly contemplates another run for the White House in 2024, and it was a frightening sign of the GOP's acquiescence to the President's dictatorial machinations and acceptance of his wild conspiracy theories.\n\n\"The Supreme Court really let us down. No wisdom, No Courage!\" Trump tweeted shortly before midnight.\n\nBut the Supreme Court's order once again affirmed that the President's legal efforts have been a total waste of time for the country at a moment when there were lives to be saved.\n\nDespite the court's solid conservative majority -- and the fact that Trump named three of the justices seated on the court -- there were no noted dissents to the court's order, which essentially said that Texas has no grounds to challenge how other states conduct their elections.\n\nJustices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas said in a statement that they would have allowed Texas to file the case on procedural grounds, but would not have granted any other relief -- making it clear that they, too, rejected the substance of Texas' arguments.\n\n\"Every American who cares about the rule of law should take comfort that the Supreme Court \u2014 including all three of President Trump's picks \u2014 closed the book on the nonsense,\" Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse -- a rare Trump critic in the GOP -- said in a statement Friday evening.\n\nStephen Vladeck, a CNN Supreme Court analyst and University of Texas Law professor, said the court's unsigned order was \"the closest possible thing to the last nail in the coffin for election-related legal challenges.\"\n\nEven Trump seemed to explicitly acknowledge earlier in the day that Biden would be the next president in a tweet calling on the Supreme Court to \"show great Courage & Wisdom\" and \"Save the USA!!\" In the same tweet, he alleged that \"the Biden administration will be a scandal-plagued mess for years to come.\" But a White House spokesman said the tweet should not be interpreted as a concession.\n\nBiden's campaign hailed the Supreme Court's decision. \"Dozens of judges, election officials from both parties, and Trump's own Attorney General have dismissed his baseless attempts to deny that he lost the election,\" Mike Gwin, Biden's campaign spokesman said. \"President-elect Biden's clear and commanding victory will be ratified by the Electoral College on Monday, and he will be sworn in on January 20th.\"\n\nTrump tries to subvert science\n\nShortly after the FDA issued emergency use authorization for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the President released a pre-recorded video on Twitter heralding the \"medical miracle\" of the arrival of a \"safe and effective vaccine in just nine months.\"\n\n\"This is one of the greatest scientific achievements in history,\" he said. \"It will save millions of lives and soon end the pandemic once and for all.\"\n\nHe thanked \"all of the brilliant scientists, technicians, doctors and workers who made this all possible,\" and highlighted the safety of the vaccines noting that the clinical trials showed that both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna were 95% effective. Moderna is seeking emergency use authorization from the FDA next week.\n\nThe first doses of the vaccine could be injected as early as Monday or Tuesday if an advisory panel to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, along with that agency, also sign off. The CDC advisory panel has now scheduled an emergency meeting for Saturday to discuss that decision.\n\n\"I promised that we would produce a vaccine in record time before the end of the year,\" Trump said. \"They said it couldn't be done, but with today's announcement, we have now achieved that goal.\"\n\nHe called the vaccine \"verifiably safe and effective,\" but hours earlier he smashed through the time-honored tradition in the United States of separating politics from science by trying to interfere in the FDA's authorization process.\n\nFrustrated by the fact that other countries like the United Kingdom began vaccinating their citizens first, the President appeared to lean on the FDA to accelerate their review -- which could increase the skittishness of Americans who are already wary of taking the vaccine because of fears it was rushed. A Gallup poll released this week showed that 63% of Americans now say they are willing to be immunized against Covid-19.\n\nOn Twitter Friday, Trump called the FDA \"a big, old, slow turtle.\"\n\n\"Get the dam vaccines out NOW, Dr. Hahn @SteveFDA,\" Trump tweeted at Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn, misspelling the word \"damn.\" \"Stop playing games and start saving lives!!!\"\n\nAt the time of his pressure campaign, sources told CNN the FDA had been expected to grant emergency use authorization either Friday or Saturday, so it was unclear why Trump felt the need to weigh in on a decision that would come within hours.\n\non Friday morning that he needed to grant an emergency use authorization for Pfizer and BioNTech's coronavirus vaccine by the end of the day or he should resign. CNN's White House team reported that White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told Hahn during a callon Friday morning that he needed to grant an emergency use authorization for Pfizer and BioNTech's coronavirus vaccine by the end of the day or he should resign.\n\nHahn called reports of the conversation, which first appeared in The Washington Post, \"an untrue representation\" and said the FDA was \"encouraged to continue working expeditiously.\"\n\nBut even Dr. Moncef Slaoui, the head of Operation Warp Speed -- the Trump administration's effort to develop and distribute vaccines against Covid-19 -- said the appearance of pressure could harm the nearly year-long efforts by top scientists and medical experts to assuage concerns about the vaccine.\n\n-- if the story is right,\" he told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"The Lead.\" Earlier this year, Slaoui told \"I think there is an opportunity there for people to see undue pressure- if the story is right,\" he told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"The Lead.\" Earlier this year, Slaoui told Science Magazine that he \"would immediately resign\" from his role with Operation Warp Speed \"if there is undue interference in this process.\"\n\nSlaoui, an immunologist who previously headed vaccine development at GlaxoSmithKline, said that the FDA has conducted \"an effective, transparent, thorough, in-depth review\" of the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine and asked Americans to \"keep an open mind\" and an eye on the transparency of the process.\n\n\"We have to go out there and engage with all of the leadership at all levels in our communities to help explain the features with of the vaccine, its performance, and hopefully engage with people and convince them\" to take it, Slaoui said.",

          "title": "FDA's Covid-19 vaccine authorization is a 'monumental moment,' expert says. It came on the deadliest day of the pandemic",
          "text": "(CNN) Shipments of Pfizer and BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine will be distributed soon across the country after the FDA on Friday authorized the vaccine for emergency use , a landmark in the pandemic.\n\n\"We need to take a moment, I think, and just consider that we are having this mass casualty event every day here in the US. But now we have this vaccine developed in record time that can in time really save us and save our country and save the world from this awful pandemic,\" emergency physician Dr. Leana Wen told CNN's Chris Cuomo moments after the authorization.\n\n\"This is really a monumental moment for us,\" she added.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration's authorization came amid one of the worst days of the pandemic for the US, with record numbers of new cases, deaths and Covid-19 patients in US hospitals.\n\nThe emergency use authorization (EUA) is a \"significant milestone\" in the fight against the pandemic, FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said in a statement Friday. He said it comes after an \"open and transparent review process that included input from independent scientific and public health experts and a thorough evaluation by the agency's career scientists.\"\n\nAn EUA stops short of a full approval. Pfizer would have to file a separate application for its vaccine to be fully licensed by the FDA.\n\nBut the EUA \"holds the promise to alter the course of this pandemic in the United States,\" said Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.\n\nTwo key steps remain before vaccinations can start. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccine advisory committee, scheduled to meet Saturday morning, must vote to recommend the vaccine. The agency next must accept that recommendation.\n\nThen vaccinations can begin. But it will be months before most Americans will get one. Advisers to the CDC have recommended healthcare workers and long-term care facility residents be first in line.\n\nOf course, Pfizer and BioNTech's vaccine is just one of those in development. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told ABC News on Friday that about 20 million Americans should be vaccinated by the end of the month, 50 million by the end of January and at least 100 million people should be vaccinated by the end of February.\n\nOfficials \"remain confident,\" he added, that there will be enough doses for any American who wants to get vaccinated by summertime.\n\nIn the meantime, the US -- ravaged by a rampant spread of the virus -- is projected to face brutal days ahead, and precautions like masking and social distancing will remain crucial.\n\nOverburdened hospitals across the US\n\nThe US reported more than 231,700 new Covid-19 infections Friday, the most ever. The average of daily cases over the last week was 210,764, another pandemic high, according to a CNN analysis of Johns Hopkins data.\n\nSome communities have already begun feeling the impacts of Thanksgiving gatherings and travel -- which officials predicted would lead to even more infections and drive another surge. And that surge could be followed by another surge tied to the upcoming Christmas holiday, some officials have said.\n\nFor at least the sixth day in a row, the US also reported another record high number of Covid-19 patients in US hospitals: more than 108,000 nationwide, according to the COVID Tracking Project.\n\nHospitals in nearly every corner of the country have felt the impact. HHS data shows more than 85% of hospitals nationwide had more Covid-19 patients last week than they did a month ago and overall, about one in five hospital inpatients were confirmed to have Covid-19 last week -- nearly double from a month earlier.\n\nIn the country's 10 largest cities, the share of hospital patients who had the virus ranged from about 9% in New York to 23% in Chicago. Meanwhile in El Paso, Texas, more than 50% of patients in city hospitals had Covid-19 between November 27 and December 3. That's nearly double the national average for that period.\n\nIn Mississippi, the state's top health official said Friday ICUs are full and \"many hospitalizations (are) on the way.\" Elective surgeries requiring hospitalization must be delayed starting Tuesday, State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs said on Twitter.\n\n\"Pressure on ICUs worse than summer surge. 26 hospitals on diversion for critically ill patients,\" Dobbs wrote a day earlier.\n\n'Unprecedented and catastrophic suffering'\n\nThe rise in hospitalized Covid-19 patients nationwide has been followed by climbing death tolls. More than 3,300 American deaths were reported Friday, marking the deadliest day since the pandemic's start. The country's previous record was set Wednesday, with more than 3,100 deaths.\n\nAs of Friday, the average number of daily deaths over the previous seven days was 2,359, the highest since the pandemic began.\n\nThe next three months will be \"really rough,\" CDC's director warned, even with a vaccine becoming available soon.\n\n\"For the next 60 to 90 days, we're going to have more deaths per day than we had in 9/11,\" Dr. Robert Redfield said Thursday. \"This is going to be a real unfortunate loss of life, as all that we've had so far.\"\n\nAnd it's a reality that a vaccine authorization won't impact, he added.\n\nIn California, Los Angeles County Public Health Director Dr. Barbara Ferrer gave a grim warning about the coming weeks, after announcing the county has doubled its number of new cases in about 10 days.\n\n\"The issue right now is what we call the Thanksgiving surge,\" Ferrer said. \"We had a surge, and now we have a surge on top of a surge, and it's really hard for us to calculate exactly what we're going to see in the next week or two.\"\n\nThe county, she said, is in \"uncharted territory,\" with case numbers and hospitalizations that \"we have not experienced and frankly did not anticipate.\"\n\n\"We're on a very dangerous track to see unprecedented and catastrophic suffering and death here in L.A. County if we can't stop the surge,\" Ferrer said.\n\nFAA urges all airports to be ready for vaccine flights\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration has urged airports nationwide to be ready for flights carrying the Covid-19 vaccine even if the airport is not scheduled to receive it.\n\nThe agency told CNN Thursday it would direct air traffic controllers to give priority clearance to flights carrying the vaccine.\n\nStates will receive shipments of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine once a week to begin with after the shots are rolled out, Operation Warp Speed Chief Adviser Moncef Slaoui said Friday.\n\n\"The plan is to ship vaccines once a week and to inform the governors a week in advance about the number of doses they will be receiving,\" Slaoui told CNN. \"Those vaccines ... are meant to be used in full in the population during that period of a week because the same states will receive an identical number of doses in the case of Pfizer's vaccine three weeks later to give as a second dose to give to the recipients of the first dose earlier,\" he said.\n\nThe number of vaccines will increase \"week on week,\" he added, as manufacturing ramps up.\n\nAnd if the Moderna vaccine is authorized, he said, \"that would be quite a significant boost of vaccine to be distributed.\" Vaccine advisers to the FDA will meet next week to discuss an EUA for Moderna's vaccine.",

          "text": "It is now Hanukkah, the Jewish holiday of miracles, where lamp oil for one day lasted for eight as the Maccabees reclaimed the holy Temple in Jerusalem from the Syrian-Greek invaders more than 2,000 years ago. The emergency use authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine Friday night by the Food and Drug Administration has the same miraculous feeling of a light at the end of the long and dark COVID-19 tunnel.\n\nBut with Christmas coming up in a few weeks, the holiday spirit that we all need is still lacking. We know it isn\u2019t safe to huddle together in stores shopping for presents, or worse, in gatherings to share holiday cheer. We walk along the streets in our masks like zombies, barely talking or looking at each other.\n\nAmerica is depressed. Suicides and drug abuse are on the rise. Families are splintered. Too many of our children are separated from their friends. Social media and remote learning don\u2019t take the place of face-to-face camaraderie.\n\nHHS SECRETARY AZAR: HOW OPERATION WARP SPEED DELIVERED A COVID VACCINE IN RECORD TIME\n\nA new Gallup poll reveals that Americans\u2019 assessment of their own mental wellbeing is lower than at any time over the past 10 years.\n\nOnly 34% of Americans say their mental health is excellent, down from 43% just a year ago. I think these numbers just scratch the surface, because almost everyone has been impacted in some way by the stress and financial and medical uncertainty surrounding COVID-19. People\u2019s lives everywhere have been disrupted.\n\nA report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in August revealed that there was a tripling of anxiety and a quadrupling of depression in over 5,000 adults surveyed now compared with a group from 2019.\n\nSubstance abuse, including alcohol, is rising dramatically. Studies from Boston University School of Public Health and from Johns Hopkins University have found that symptoms of depression and psychological distress were triple those found in 2018.\n\nSome of the people most effected have preexisting mental health problems, but this vulnerable group is far from the only ones affected.\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t in the U.S. alone. A recent study from Japan, which has done a far better job controlling its COVID-19 outbreak than we have, showed that there have been more deaths in Japan from suicide in October alone than deaths from COVID-19 during the entire pandemic.\n\nHere in the U.S., the sense of anxiety is almost palpable. Parents everywhere are heartbroken because their young children are forced to adapt to a sparse stay-at-home life.\n\nLuckily, it seems that help is finally on the way, with the emergency use authorization authorized for the first Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine Friday night. This holiday miracle (highly effective vaccine development at an unprecedented rate of speed) couldn\u2019t be coming at a better time.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nA recent Gallup poll revealed that now 63% of Americans are willing to take the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nIt will take months to widely distribute this vaccine, so in the meantime, we must continue to wear our masks, wash our hands, physically distance and test for COVID-19 whenever we travel. We must resist our COVID fatigue and fears, and comply with a more uniform public health response in order to lessen the burden on our hospitals and our entire health care system.\n\nBut I do not feel we can cancel Christmas. We must be cautious, keep to very small groups of people we know, and avoid gatherings. We must limit travel and not live in denial of COVID.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut we can\u2019t allow the Christmas Grinch to steal our hopes for a better and less-restricted future or our belief in miracles now in real-time. We must hang in there and not allow the Hanukkah candles to blow out.\n\nHelp is on the way.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM DR. MARC SIEGEL",

But around 8:30 p.m., guests were informed that Mr. Trump would not be coming down from the residence to speak.\n\nMr. Trump weighed in later on Twitter. \u201cThe Supreme Court really let us down,\u201d he said. \u201cNo Wisdom, No Courage!\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s order was not quite unanimous. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, issued a brief statement on a technical point. But it was nonetheless a comprehensive rebuke to Mr. Trump and his allies. It was plain that the justices had no patience for Texas\u2019 attempt to enlist the court in an effort to tell other states how to run their elections.\n\nThe majority ruled that Texas could not file its lawsuit at all. \u201cThe state of Texas\u2019 motion for leave to file a bill of complaint is denied for lack of standing,\u201d the court\u2019s order said.\n\nJustice Alito, taking a slightly different approach, wrote that the court was not free immediately to shut down lawsuits filed by states directly in the court. \u201cIn my view,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwe do not have discretion to deny the filing of a bill of complaint in a case that falls within our original jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nBut that was as far as those two justices were willing to go. \u201cI would therefore grant the motion to file the bill of complaint but would not grant other relief,\u201d Justice Alito wrote, \u201cand I express no view on any other issue.\u201d\n\nSome of Mr. Trump\u2019s advisers had anticipated the court would give the president and the Republican attorneys general something that could be characterized as supportive, in the form of a dissent or a lengthy commentary. Instead, there was simply the brief statement from the two justices.",

Biden Jr. on Monday, leaves the president\u2019s party in an extraordinary position. Through their explicit endorsements or complicity of silence, much of the G.O.P. leadership now shares responsibility for the quixotic attempt to ignore the nation\u2019s founding principles and engineer a different verdict from the one voters cast on Election Day.\n\nMany regular Republicans supported this effort, too \u2014 a sign that Mr. Trump has not just bent the party to his will, but pressed a mainstay of American politics for nearly two centuries into the service of overturning an election outcome and assaulting public faith in the electoral system. The G.O.P. sought to undo the vote by such spurious means that the conservative majority on the Supreme Court quickly rejected the argument.\n\nEven some Republican leaders delivered a withering assessment of the 126 G.O.P. House members and 18 attorneys general who chose to side with Mr. Trump over the democratic process, by backing a lawsuit that asked the Supreme Court to throw out some 20 million votes in four key states that cemented the president\u2019s loss.",

Josh Shapiro, the attorney general of Pennsylvania and a Democrat, said that the Supreme Court had recognized the lawsuit as a \u201cseditious abuse of the judicial process.\u201d\n\nThough legal experts never gave the case much of a chance, it drew support from more than 120 Republican members of Congress and 17 Republican attorneys general.

In addition, all three countries have made advance purchases from other companies, as well, so the pace of vaccine approval could significantly affect the speed of rollout.\n\nThat speed will also be affected by the need for vaccination sites to be equipped with the right freezers, the staff to prepare the shots, and enough syringes and protective gear.\n\nThe initial shipments are a small fraction of the pre-purchases \u2014 800,000 doses to Britain and an expected 249,000 this month to Canada.\n\nU.S. officials have said they hope to have 40 million doses of the vaccine by the end of the month, which may be optimistic. That would be enough to inoculate 20 million people.\n\nRural areas where hospitals are not equipped to keep the vaccines at the right temperatures, or do not have the staff to prepare them for injection, will not receive the Pfizer shots. That is more of an obstacle in the United States and Canada, huge countries with vast, sparsely populated regions, than in Britain, which is much more compact.\n\nIn Canada, where the military is playing a central role in vaccine distribution, the government is sending shipments to all 10 provinces.

It also exposed a younger generation to the battlefield sacrifices and the shocking failures of leadership that led to the surprise concerted Arab attack on Yom Kippur, led by the Egyptian and Syrian armies. The period is so painful that Israeli culture has rarely dared to grapple with it.\n\n\u201cThis was our worst trauma and our worst disaster as a country,\u201d said Ron Leshem, who cocreated the series together with Amit Cohen, both veterans of the Israeli military\u2019s elite 8200 intelligence unit. \u201cFor 47 years, people had the feeling this was a forgotten war and that they would end their lives without anyone knowing their stories,\u201d Mr. Leshem added. \u201cWe knew we had an awful responsibility.\u201d\n\nThe series, aired by the Israeli public broadcaster Kan, was 10 years in the making with a multimillion-dollar budget far exceeding those of typical Israeli productions. It featured heart-stopping recreations of epic tank battles in their original locations in the Golan Heights, which Israel had seized from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war. In 1973, the Syrians attacked from the north and the Egyptians from the south.",

The UK is also readying four Royal Navy patrol ships to help protect its fishing waters from 1 January in the event a deal cannot be reached.\n\nPlay Video 2:17 'New beginnings for old friends': EU commission chief warns Brexit agreement not reached yet \u2013 video\n\nThe 80-metre-long vessels, armed with machine guns, would have the power to halt, inspect and impound all EU fishing boats operating within the UK\u2019s exclusive economic zone (EEZ), which can extend 200 miles from shore.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on a visit to Blyth in Northumberland on Friday, Johnson said fishing was one of two significant impediments to a deal \u2013 the other being how to maintain fair competition once the UK is able to set its own standards and regulations from the end of the transition period in three weeks\u2019 time.\n\nOn Saturday, Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative chair of the commons defence committee, called the threat to use Royal Navy gunboats to protect UK fishing waters irresponsible at a time of more pressing threats.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re facing the undignified prospect right now of our overstretched Royal Navy squaring up to a close Nato ally over fishing vessel rights when we are witnessing an increasing presence of Russian drone activity and subsurface activity \u2013 our adversaries must really be enjoying this blue on blue,\u201d the former defence minister told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t Elizabethan times any more, this is global Britain \u2013 we need to be raising the bar much higher than this.\u201d\n\nHe said the focus should be on reaching a deal, warning that failure to do so \u201cwould be so damaging to Britain \u2013 it would be a retrograde step, a failure of statecraft\u201d.\n\nHowever Sir Alan West, a former admiral and chief of naval staff, said the navy should protect UK waters from foreign fishing vessels if asked to do so in a no-deal Brexit scenario.\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely appropriate that the Royal Navy should protect our waters if the position is that we are a sovereign state and our government has said we don\u2019t want other nations there,\u201d the peer told Today.\n\n\u201cThere are complications in that you can push vessels aside, you can cut their fishing tackle, but boarding these foreign ships, they\u2019ll need to pass probably a little thing through parliament to give authority to board and get on them.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt if you are a fisherman who has fished for years there \u2013 they are, as our fishermen are, quite stormy people \u2013 and you get a bit of a punch-up and you might need some marines and things.\u201d\n\nThe French MEP Pierre Karleskind, the chairman of the European parliament\u2019s committee on fisheries, also warned about the consequences of no deal, as he called for calm about the potential deployment of the Royal Navy vessels.\n\nPlay Video 1:11 Boris Johnson says it is 'very likely' UK will leave EU on WTO terms \u2013 video\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s keep cool. Let\u2019s keep calm. I was just looking at a history book,\u201d he told Times Radio. \u201cThe creation of the French Royal Navy was done in 1294 in response to naval battles between French and English fishermen. So this is a long, long history between our two nations.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying it\u2019s about fish but let\u2019s think just a few seconds. Do you really think it\u2019s only about fish that navy ships are used and will be used? I don\u2019t think so. I think there are other interests like the control of the border, especially the question of migrants.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI really think a no-deal would be a lose-lose deal. Lose for you, lose for us. I\u2019m pretty sure of that. I don\u2019t know if a deal would be a win-win, but I\u2019m absolutely sure that a no-deal would be a lose-lose deal.\u201d\n\nJohnson declared on Friday that a no deal on trade was \u201cvery likely\u201d as it emerged that Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel flatly rejected his appeal for direct talks earlier in the week. The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, issued a similar warning about the trajectory of the talks earlier on Friday.",

Labour is backed by 20% of Leave voters and 53% of Remain voters.\n\nIt represents a swing to Labour from the Tories among Leave voters of 5.5 points. The swing among Remainers was just 1.5 points. The pollsters said that a significant part of the swing was down to Leave voters turning against the Tories, now saying they did not now know who they would vote for. Some 18% of Conservative Leave voters now say they do not know how they will vote.\n\nMeanwhile, the net movement of Conservative voters to Labour since the election is roughly the same as the net movement of Green and Lib Dem voters to Labour \u2013 about 500,000 voters in each group. It challenges suggestions that Starmer has largely boosted Labour\u2019s vote share by winning Lib Dem and Green voters.\n\nThe study, launched as part of a new Opinium ebook on the last election, comes with Labour poised to back any Brexit deal that is agreed with the EU. The move is causing unease at all levels of the party. Starmer has suggested he will order his MPs to back a deal in the \u201cnational interest\u201d, making clear it is preferable to a no-deal outcome.\n\nChris Curtis, the senior research manager at Opinium, said: \u201cThis data will be particularly important for Labour to consider when deciding how to vote on a potential Brexit deal. The data shows that there are lots of Leave voters who are going off the Conservative party, but haven\u2019t yet been won over by Labour. The party will want to avoid alienating them with the decision it makes.\u201d\n\nSeveral figures in the shadow cabinet, the unions and prominent backbenchers want the party to abstain in a Brexit deal vote, concerned that backing a deal will prevent Labour from criticising it in the future \u2013 while abstaining will not stop its passage.\n\nHowever, Starmer\u2019s team has been holding meetings with party figures for weeks in an attempt to prepare the ground for voting in favour of a deal. There is also a feeling among Starmer\u2019s team that Remain voters are not as focused on Brexit as they once were, following the last election.\n\nThe Opinium study found that Starmer is doing better among Leave voters than the Labour party as a whole, suggesting that he may have the ability to reach some more Tory voters who are increasingly becoming dissatisfied with the party, but have yet to make the jump to Labour. Starmer\u2019s approval rating among Leave voters was -5, with 27% approving of him and 32% disapproving.\n\nA huge lead for the Tories among older voters at the last election is also showing evidence of closing. The Conservatives had a 38-point lead among those aged 65 and over. It remains high, but has closed to 26 points.\n\nLabour has a marginal lead among working-class voters, following suggestions it was behind among that group at the election. It is now backed by 40% of so-called \u201cC2DE\u201d voters, compared with 38% for the Tories. Meanwhile, the Tories lead among the more affluent voters. It leads 42% to 38% among \u201cABC1\u201d voters. The gender gap that emerged at the last election persists. The Tories lead 43% to 35% among men, while Labour leads 41% to 38% among women.\n\nCurtis said: \u201cLabour\u2019s vote share has increased under the leadership of Keir Starmer, with the party now just two points behind the Conservatives. But what is more interesting are the trends underlying the swing back to the party. Labour is seeing greater swings towards them among older voters and Leave voters, the key groups they have struggled with in recent years. This indicates that some of the major divides that have haunted our politics for the past few years might be starting to fade.\n\n\u201cA key element seems to be the handling of the pandemic, with many Leave voters who backed the Tories last year thinking the government has done a bad job. The party is therefore only holding on to 70% of the Leave voters who backed them, as opposed to 78% of their Remain voters.\u201d\n\nOpinium polled about 7,000 people online between 27 November and 8 December.",

          "text": "Alfred Bourgeois\u2019s IQ put him in the intellectually disabled category, which should have barred execution, lawyers say\n\nThe Trump administration continued its unprecedented series of post-election federal executions Friday by putting to death a Louisiana truck driver who abused and killed his two-year-old daughter.\n\nAlfred Bourgeois, 56, was pronounced dead at 8.21pm eastern time after receiving a lethal injection at the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana.\n\nHis lawyers argued Bourgeois had an IQ that puts him in the intellectually disabled category, saying that should have made him ineligible for the death penalty under federal law. Victor J Abreu said it was \u201cshameful\u201d to execute his client \u201cwithout fair consideration of his intellectual disability\u201d.\n\n'Abolish the death penalty': Brandon Bernard execution prompts wave of anger Read more\n\nBourgeois was the 10th federal death-row inmate put to death since federal executions resumed under Donald Trump in July after a 17-year hiatus. He was the second federal prisoner executed this week, with three more executions planned in January.\n\nBourgeois met with his spiritual adviser on Friday as he sought to come to terms with the possibility of dying, and he was also praying, one of his lawyers, Shawn Nolan told the Associated Press just hours before the execution.\n\n\u201cHe certainly doesn\u2019t want to die \u2013 and it\u2019s harder for him to grasp being killed by the federal government. But he does get it that this is bad.\u201d\n\nThe attorney added: \u201cHe\u2019s praying for redemption.\u201d\n\nBourgeois took up drawing in prison, including doing renditions of members of his legal team. Nolan said he had not been a troublemaker on death row and had a good disciplinary record.\n\nThe last time the number of civilians executed federally reached double digits in a year was under President Grover Cleveland, with 14 in 1896.\n\nThe series of executions under Trump since election day, the first in late November, also marks the first time in more than 130 years that federal executions have occurred during a lame-duck period. Cleveland was also the last president to do that.\n\nOn Thursday, Brandon Bernard was put to death for his part in a 1999 killing of a religious couple from Iowa after he and other teenage members of a gang abducted and robbed Todd and Stacie Bagley in Texas. The death of Bernard, who was 18 at the time of the killings, was a rare execution of a person who was in his teens when his crime was committed.\n\nSeveral high-profile figures, including Kim Kardashian West, appealed to Trump to commute Bernard\u2019s sentence to life in prison, citing, among other things, Bernard\u2019s youth at the time and the remorse he has expressed over years.\n\nIn Bourgeois\u2019s case, the crimes stand out as particularly brutal because they involved his young daughter.\n\nAccording to court filings, he gained temporary custody of the child after a 2002 paternity suit from a Texas woman. Bourgeois was living in Louisiana with his wife and their two children.\n\nOver the next month, Bourgeois whipped the girl with an electrical cord, burned her feet with a cigarette lighter and hit her in the head with a plastic baseball bat so hard that her head swelled \u2013 then refused to seek medical treatment for her, court documents say. Prosecutors also said he sexually abused her.\n\nIt was during a trucking run to Corpus Christi, Texas, that he ended up killing the toddler, slamming her head on the windows and dashboard four times, court filings say. She died the next day in a hospital of brain injuries.\n\nAfter his 2004 conviction, a judge rejected claims stemming from his alleged intellectual disability, noting he did not receive a diagnosis until after he was sentenced to death.\n\nAttorneys argued that finding was based on misunderstandings about such disabilities. They said Bourgeois had tests that demonstrated his IQ was around 70, well below average, and that his childhood history buttressed their claims.\n\nBourgeois\u2019s lawyers did not argue that he should have been acquitted or should not have been handed a stiff penalty, just that he should not be executed, Nolan said.\n\n",

          "text": "\u201cThat\u2019s my duty, but it\u2019s hard work to get to it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe string of vaccination centers being built across the country come before Germany even has a vaccine to distribute. European approval of the Pfizer vaccine is expected sometime this month.\n\nThe German approach could be watched closely by the United States and other countries around the world as they eye ways to vaccinate their populations as speedily as possible.\n\nTime constraints are particularly pressing with the Pfizer vaccine \u2014 developed by the German firm BioNTech with German government funding \u2014 because of its cold storage requirements.\n\nThe vaccine can only survive for about five days after being defrosted from minus-94 degrees and comes in trays of just under 1,000 doses, so experts say it makes sense for people to come to a central location that can get as many people in and out as possible.\n\nBritain, which began giving its first vaccines through hospitals earlier this week, is also expected to open mass vaccination centers next year.\n\n\u201cWe asked the federal states to be ready by Dec. 15. And we are confident they will be,\u201d said Hanno Kautz, a spokesperson for Germany\u2019s Health Ministry.\n\nVaccination centers are being constructed because \u201cyou want to be quick,\u201d he said, and there simply isn\u2019t the space at hospitals, he said.\n\nConstruction is underway in all 16 German states. The central state of Hessen has said it will have 28 centers ready before the week is out, with the capacity to vaccinate 28,000 a day. Michael Schaich, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry said that operations have been tested, including a \u201cseamless logistics chain.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are well prepared,\u201d he said.\n\nThe western state Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg is setting up nine large centers for its 11 million people, with 44 more community vaccination points to be added in January.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better to have [vaccination centers] ready and there are delays than the other way around: having the vaccine and no vaccination centers ready to go,\u201d Health Minister Jens Spahn told reporters last week as he visited a new vaccination center in a D\u00fcsseldorf soccer ground set up to give 2,800 shots a day. The health ministry did not provide numbers on how many vaccination centers it expects to be ready next week.\n\nThe cost of Berlin\u2019s six centers will range between around $70 million and $95 million, according to Broemmer, with other federal states outlining similar investments.\n\nAt Arena Berlin, where Broemmer was overseeing the work, there are 80 small cubicles planned for the center designed to vaccinate 4,000 people a day. The aim is to vaccinate 450,000 people in Berlin \u2014 around 10 percent of the population \u2014 within three months.\n\nBut that will depend on supplies, and little is certain.\n\nBroemmer sketched out his plans for the space with a Lego brick model before handing them along to architects.\n\nCenters will have a waiting area where patients will be monitored for half an hour for side effects before they are allowed to leave.\n\nAbout 20 doctors will oversee the center at any one time, with about 150 staff members and volunteers. Those administering shots will be drawn from organizations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, and Broemmer said the city also was in discussions with airlines including Lufthansa and easyJet about using flight attendants who have first aid training.\n\nEurope has purchased an initial 200 million doses of the vaccine, double the initial order from the United States. But Germany has also secured an additional 40 million outside the European Union contract.\n\nGermany\u2019s federal states have scrambled to procure the deep freezers necessary for the vaccine storage. That was a challenge, Broemmer said.\n\n\u201cThe problem is to find these fridges,\u201d he said. \u201cWe ordered them two months ago, and we got them.\u201d\n\nThere are three for all Berlin, enough to store the 900,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine that it hopes to initially receive.\n\nIn Hessen, Schaich said that his state had also made an \u201cearly effort\u201d to get freezers without giving specifics. \u201cThere are only a few suppliers for this ultra-freezing,\u201d he said.\n\nBerlin\u2019s three freezers will be kept at a central location in the city, one of 27 \u201cdistribution hubs\u201d across the country, the location of which won\u2019t be made public for security reasons.\n\nThere are concerns that the centers could be targets for anti-vaxxers and followers of conspiracy theories. Germany has a vociferous anti-lockdown movement that has been becoming increasingly radicalized, with police still investigating an arson attack on the building of the federal agency for infectious-disease control in late October.\n\nOn Wednesday, the domestic intelligence agency in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, home to some of the largest demonstrations, said it would put their main organizers \u2014 a group called Querdenken 711 \u2014 under observation.\n\n\u201cWe never know what happens around, what happens at night,\u201d Broemmer said. \u201cThere might be arson or something like this. There might be some people that want to make trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe never know,\u201d he said.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, Germany has been quick to put in motion practical measures such as contact tracing, which took other countries months to roll out. However, now it\u2019s struggling to bring down the number of new cases, as daily deaths reach a record high.\n\nBroemmer was also responsible for overseeing the construction of an overspill hospital in an exhibition center in Berlin during the first wave of the pandemic last spring, which cost around $40 million but has not taken in a single patient.",

          "text": "Known as \u201cCacique\u201d or \u201cChief\u201d because of his Inca heritage, Mr. Olmedo was a 5-foot-10 right-hander who lit up the amateur tennis scene in the late 1950s, winning top tournaments nearly a decade before Grand Slam events were opened to professionals. Official, computerized tennis rankings were still years away, but at his peak in 1959 he was considered the top amateur in the United States and No. 2 in the world.\n\nRightly or not, he was also deemed one of the sport\u2019s most frustrating players, losing to second-rate opponents and struggling at times to elevate his game for matches he was expected to win. \u201cThere is nothing else quite like Olmedo in the formful world of tennis,\u201d Sports Illustrated journalist James Murray wrote in a 1959 cover story. \u201cHe is the world\u2019s best amateur tennis player one day. And he is plain run-of-the-mill the next.\u201d\n\nThe son of a groundskeeper and tennis instructor, Mr. Olmedo grew up playing at a local club in Arequipa, Peru\u2019s second-largest city. By most accounts, he came to the United States in 1954 after local supporters raised $700, enabling him to take a boat to Havana, a plane to Miami and a cross-country bus to Los Angeles. He spoke no English, and later spoke of a \u201cguardian angel\u201d watching over him on the Greyhound.\n\nHe went on to work at a tennis pro shop, where he said he \u201cstrung rackets and made malts and hamburgers\u201d while developing his game, ultimately catching the eye of Perry T. Jones, the czar of Southern California\u2019s amateur tennis scene. When Jones was named captain of America\u2019s 1958 Davis Cup squad, he successfully lobbied for Mr. Olmedo \u2014 by then winning NCAA titles for USC \u2014 to join the team.\n\nThe decision irritated some current and former tennis players, as Mr. Olmedo was not American (he later became a naturalized citizen) and the tournament was a showcase for national pride. But Peru wasn\u2019t fielding a team, and Mr. Olmedo silenced his critics after powering the United States to victory over Australia, ending a three-year winning streak by defeating Ashley Cooper, the reigning Wimbledon champion, in the finals on New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\n\u201cWe did it, Cap. We won,\u201d Mr. Olmedo yelled to Jones, shedding a few tears on the court and throwing his racket in celebration. He received a congratulatory telegram from actor Kirk Douglas (\u201cNow you are more than a chief. You are a superchief\u201d) and was crowned with a laurel wreath during a triumphant return to Peru.\n\nMr. Olmedo won his first Grand Slam championship that same year, partnering with Davis Cup teammate Ham Richardson to win the men\u2019s doubles title at the 1958 U.S. National Championships. Months later, he defeated Neale Fraser to win the 1959 Australian Championships, becoming only the second Latin American to win an individual Grand Slam title, after Chile\u2019s Anita Lizana won the U.S. Nationals in 1937.\n\nHis victory set him up for the No. 1 seed at Wimbledon, where he defeated 20-year-old Rod Laver in straight sets in the finals of the world\u2019s oldest tennis tournament. \u201cHe took his fast and aggressive game, and rocked the tennis world,\u201d the International Tennis Hall of Fame later said.\n\nMr. Olmedo and Brazilian Maria Bueno, who won the women\u2019s championship the next day, became the first South Americans to win individual titles at Wimbledon. He nearly won a third Grand Slam that year at the U.S. Nationals, where his former Australian opponent, Fraser, got revenge in the finals, winning in four sets.\n\nBut his success in major tournaments was accompanied by a number of disastrous matches. He was blamed for the American team\u2019s loss in the 1959 Davis Cup, when he dropped two matches in the final round, and was charged with throwing a clay-court match after a lackadaisical performance near Chicago.\n\nSports Illustrated later reported that Mr. Olmedo had not wanted to play in the clay tournament anyway, and was insulted when he arrived at the club and the gatekeeper didn\u2019t recognize him. In the predominantly White world of high-level tennis, he was sometimes mistaken for tournament staff.\n\n\u201cIn Europe people treat you much better. I feel better over there because they know a player is a human being over there,\u201d he said at the time. Exhausted by an amateur sports system in which he had to pay his own way to tournaments, then arrived to be treated poorly, he turned pro in December 1959, signing a contract that reportedly guaranteed him a minimum of $35,000.\n\nMr. Olmedo won the U.S. Pro Tennis Championships the next year and retired in 1965 with an overall record of 90-85. He was tired of traveling, he said, and wanted to focus on raising his family in Los Angeles, where he taught tennis until his death. He became the teaching pro at the Beverly Hills Hotel and worked with celebrities including Katharine Hepburn, Robert Duvall and Charlton Heston, describing himself as \u201ckind of a therapist\u201d on the tennis court, according to his son.\n\nGreeting clients with a standard line \u2014 \u201cHow you doing, champ?\u201d \u2014 he helped them with their serve or backhand while also chatting about life and work. \u201cThey come to see me to make themselves feel better about themselves,\u201d he would say, \u201cand to hit some tennis balls.\u201d\n\nThe second of seven children, Luis Alejandro Olmedo y Rodr\u00edguez was born in Arequipa on March 24, 1936. His family said that Mr. Olmedo started playing with a homemade wooden racket by age 4 or 5, and within a decade had beaten everyone in town. He went to Lima, the capital, where the head of the Peruvian tennis association connected him with American coach Stanley Singer, setting him on a path to come to the United States.\n\nMr. Olmedo was 15 when he made his amateur debut at the 1951 U.S. Nationals, losing his first match. His son and former wife, Ann Peirce Olmedo, said that he had already made his epic boat-plane-and-bus trip to Los Angeles by then, in contrast to news reports that suggested he made the journey three years later.\n\nBy all accounts, he learned English at night school soon after arriving, and studied at Modesto Junior College before enrolling at USC to play under tennis coach George Toley. He won NCAA doubles and individual championships in both 1956 and 1958, and helped lead the Trojans to a 1958 team championship.\n\nMr. Olmedo was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1987.\n\nHis marriage ended in divorce. In addition to his son, Alex Olmedo Jr. of Santa Monica, survivors include two daughters, Amy Olmedo of Los Angeles and Angie Williams of Paia, Hawaii; four brothers; a sister; and four grandchildren.\n\nIn a phone interview, his son recalled that Mr. Olmedo was still leading private lessons until shortly before his death, working with clients on an extra-wide, extra-long court that Mr. Olmedo had installed outside his home in Encino.\n\n\u201cWhen he was around people, he would just turn on the charm,\u201d Olmedo Jr. said. \u201cIf you were a beginner, he was so precise he could hit the ball exactly to your sweet spot and make you feel like you were a better player than you were. That\u2019s the key to being a pro, making people feel good about their abilities while also helping them improve. People would come back and say, \u2018What\u2019s going on, how come I can\u2019t play as well against other people as I do against you?\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd he\u2019d say, \u2018Well, champ, you\u2019ve got to keep coming back.\u2019 \u201d",

It sailed through the Senate on Wednesday night and is expected to clear the lower house soon.\n\nThe measure would require that Mexican federal, state and local officials get permission from a high-level security panel to talk with \u201cforeign agents\u201d such as those working for the FBI or Drug Enforcement Administration. The Mexican officials would be required to provide a written report about such meetings to the Foreign and Public Security ministries. A representative of the Foreign Ministry would have to sit in on the sessions.\n\n\u201cIt will dramatically change the way Mexican law enforcement and U.S. law enforcement cooperate,\u201d said Ana Mar\u00eda Salazar, a Mexico City-based security analyst who worked in drug enforcement under the Clinton administration. \u201cThe extreme requirements will probably paralyze the relationship.\u201d\n\nThe measure could affect a wide range of investigations \u2014 involving drug-trafficking, money-laundering, kidnapping and other crimes.\n\nU.S. agents are unlikely to share sensitive information under such conditions because it could easily fall into the hands of corrupt officials if distributed widely, former officials say. \u201cThat would compromise agents, informants and investigations,\u201d said Mike Vigil, a former chief of international operations for the DEA.\n\nU.S. Attorney General William P. Barr said in a statement that the Justice Department was \u201ctroubled\u201d by the legislation, which he said would complicate bilateral cooperation. \u201cThe passage of this legislation can only benefit the violent transnational criminal organizations and other criminals that we are jointly fighting,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother department official said the measure could have a dramatic impact on bilateral relations. \u201cThe immediate effect is a freeze\u201d on sharing information, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to give interviews.\n\nDrug cooperation is particularly important because Mexico is the main source of heroin and methamphetamines in the United States, as well as a major gateway for cocaine and fentanyl.\n\nRoberto Velasco, the senior official handling U.S. affairs at the Foreign Ministry, said diplomats had met with officials from the State and Justice departments to explain details of the bill. \u201cIt is in our shared interest to continue working together on law enforcement,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe aim of the bill is for our cooperation to continue on the basis of mutual respect, and shared objectives.\u201d\n\nCienfuegos served as defense minister from 2012 to 2018, under President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. He was charged in October in U.S. federal court with helping the H-2 drug cartel, based in northwestern Mexico, to ship heroin, cocaine and methamphetamines to the United States. He pleaded not guilty. Many Mexicans said they believed him; Cienfuegos was not widely perceived as corrupt and had worked on anti-drug efforts with U.S. officials.\n\nThe detention was seen in Mexico as a slap at the military \u2014 which is highly regarded and has become a central player in L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s security and infrastructure plans. Mexico responded to the arrest by threatening to curtail security cooperation with the United States. The Trump administration dropped the charges citing \u201cforeign policy considerations\u201d and sent Cienfuegos home. But that wasn\u2019t the end of the story.\n\nMexican officials have portrayed the law as necessary to guarantee their sovereignty. \u201cI think there\u2019s a national awakening\u201d after the Cienfuegos case, said Ricardo Monreal, a ruling-party lawmaker who guided the legislation through the Senate. \u201cWe want a harmonious relationship with the United States, but not one of subordination.\u201d\n\nHe said the language in the legislation was originally harsher. \u201cIt was moderated because the president wants a good relationship\u201d with Washington, he said.\n\nForeign Ministry officials noted that many parts of the legislation, such as providing only limited diplomatic immunity for foreign agents, are copied from bilateral agreements reached years ago. But the legislation adds new provisions. And it is part of the national security law, which allows criminal charges \u2014 even treason \u2014 against violators, noted Jorge Lara, a former senior Mexican justice official.\n\n\u201cThis will result in many people preferring not to take the risk\u201d of meeting with U.S. agents, he said. \u201cThis will generate a kind of paranoia.\u201d\n\nThe law was introduced during a political vacuum in the United States, with the Trump administration on the brink of leaving office and a Biden team not yet confirmed. Mexican diplomats insist L\u00f3pez Obrador wants a good relationship with the incoming U.S. leader. But Lara said the Mexican government could be using the measure to gain leverage with Biden.Senior members of the armed forces were infuriated by the arrest of Cienfuegos, whom many had served with over the years. The case was built in the United States, relying on intercepted BlackBerry messages allegedly involving the general and drug traffickers. But it sparked alarm among other senior members of the Mexican government who feared that the DEA might be tapping their phones.\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador, a longtime leftist, has developed a surprisingly warm relationship with President Trump. But he also relies heavily on Mexico\u2019s military, both for domestic security and numerous other duties, from building a new Mexico City airport to transporting medications during the coronavirus pandemic.",
