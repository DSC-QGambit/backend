          "title": "New Delhi's Khan Market Ranked 22nd Most Expensive Retail Market Globally",
          "text": "When you think about the most expensive cities in India, what instantly comes to mind? Mumbai? Bangalore? Well, this may be true, but none of these cities comprise the most expensive retail market. It can be found in the national capital. As per a report released by Cushman & Wakefield, a real estate consultancy firm, New Delhi's Khan Market has emerged as the most expensive retail market in the country.\n\nGlobally, the market is the 22nd most expensive retail market, with 3 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in its rentals. It has an annual rent of $217 per square foot.\n\n\n\nBCCL\n\nAs per this report, over 16 Indian street markets have emerged on this list out of the 51 most expensive main street markets in the APAC region. According to this report, Fifth Avenue in New York City retains its top ranking as the world\u2019s most expensive retail destination, despite recording flat rental growth. YOY and Milan\u2019s Via Montenapoleone jumped to the second spot, displacing Hong Kong\u2019s Tsim Sha Tsui, which has now come down to the third spot.\n\n\u201cPre-pandemic to present growth in rentals at Khan Market was recorded at 7 percent, while the YOY growth in rentals at the high street market was 3 percent. This got Khan Market the 22nd spot on the global Main Street list. At present, Khan Market commands a rent of $217 per square foot per year (around Rs 1506 per sq ft per month),\u201d the report mentioned.\n\nBCCL\n\nOther than that, the biggest jump has been made by Istiklal Street in Istanbul, where it reached the 20th spot from the 31st spot. This has occurred mainly due to inflation, which has doubled the rents.\n\nSaurabh Shatdal, Managing Director, Capital Markets, Cushman & Wakefield India, said, \u201cIndian main streets, especially the prominent ones, have benefited from a dearth of space across quality-grade retail malls. Main street rentals have grown by 10% year over year.\u201d\n\n\"One of the main reasons behind this is that while demand for retail space has been recovering strongly post-pandemic, supply of grade A-quality malls hasn\u2019t kept pace,\" Shatdal added.\n\nPexels\n\nFor all the Delhites who may think that Khan Market is much more expensive than it used to be, it probably is.",

          "title": "Former GTA Developer Spills Details On 'Agent', Rockstar's Cancelled Spy Game",
          "text": "An ex-GTA developer has revealed key details of \u2018Agent\u2019, the cancelled spy game inspired by James Bond by Rockstar Games. The game was originally announced for the PS3 but never saw the light of the day, silently cancelled by Rockstar in favour of working on its premiere franchises. Agent started development right after GTA San Andreas, with work being handled by Rockstar San Diego. The plan, according to Vermeij\u2019s blog post (which has since been taken down), was to split Rockstar North\u2019s development team into half, working on both Agent and GTA IV simultaneously.\n\n\u00a9 Rockstar Games\n\nEx-Rockstar technical director Obbe Vermeij has shed some light on key details of Agent, revealing that it was essentially a Scottish version of a James Bond adventure. Agent was to be developed alongside GTA 4 and, contrasting that game, would\u2019ve been a more linear title set in the 1970s. The game would see levels set in Cairo and a French Mediterranean city, but would eventually make its way into Space in its finale. To get the greenlight, Vermeij and his team, including former Rockstar president Leslie Benzies, presented a demo \u201cdoing some spy stuff\u201d using San Andreas\u2019 code.\n\n\u201cThe game wasn't progressing as well as we'd hoped,\u201d wrote Vermeij on his blog. \u201cIt was inevitable that eventually the whole company would have to get behind gta4. We tried to cut the game down in an attempt the (sic) get the bulk of it done before the inevitable call from NY would come. We cut out an entire level (I think Cairo) and maybe even the space section.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Rockstar Games\n\nIn the end, Agent was handed off to another studio within Rockstar before its eventual cancellation. Vermeij writes that the game, internally codenamed \u201cJimmy\u201d, was \u201cgoing to be too much of a distraction\u201d for the team and was hence ditched. Vermeij\u2019s blog post gives us some interesting insight into Rockstar\u2019s plans in the early era of the PS3, including plans for a zombie survival game.\n\nWhile it\u2019s a shame that we won\u2019t see Agent or Bully 2, Rockstar Games is busy enough developing the next GTA game, with the first official reveal coming in early December. GTA 6 will include advanced animations, factions, improved AI for NPCs, dual protagonists and even horses, as revealed in a leaked datamine.\n\nGrand Theft Auto VI is currently in development with no target release date or platforms. Rockstar Games\u2019 last major release, Red Dead Redemption (remaster) is available now on PS4, PS5 (via backwards compatibility) and Nintendo Switch. GTA V is now available for PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles.\n\nThis article was produced as part of a partnership between Indiatimes and GLHF.",

When Brandon was just seven years old, police showed up at his door to arrest him. Brandon\u2019s offense? Tagging along with his older brothers who\u2019d wrestled in a vacant duplex and left some holes in the drywall. Now police were there to take Brandon and his brothers to the juvenile detention center, jail, basically.\n\nspeaker 1 My mom said that they weren\u2019t going to take me in. But they were like, well, he needs to learn his lesson.\n\nmeribah knight\n\nBrandon was held in detention overnight and then brought to the juvenile court for his hearing.\n\nspeaker 1 They had me in shackles, from our feet to our arms, going into court.\n\nmeribah knight\n\nBrandon should have gone home with his mom that day. But when he went before the judge, she sent him back to jail for a week. Brandon\u2019s arrest and detention happened in Rutherford County, Tennessee. And his case wasn\u2019t unique there. For over a decade, the county was arresting and jailing kids for even the most minor offenses.\n\nspeaker 2 I didn\u2019t want to go to school. speaker 3 I just ran away. speaker 4 I spray painted a penis on a wall.\n\nmeribah knight\n\nIt happened so often, to so many kids in Rutherford County, that getting sent to juvenile detention was almost a rite of passage. In many cases, what it also was was illegal. This is the story of how that system came to be, how it came to be normalized, accepted, lauded even. It\u2019s also the story of two insiders who actually did see the problem in Rutherford County.\n\nspeaker 5 We would sit out, and smoke a cigarette, and say, we\u2019re going to burn this place to the ground.

Don\u2019t be scared! Contrary to popular belief, the crossword is not a competition over how much trivia one knows. Yes, random facts and knowledge will come in handy when you\u2019re filling out the crossword grid, but believe in yourself.\n\nWhen attacking the grid head-on, take a few tries to figure out your style of solving. Jackie likes to go around the grid and fill in what she knows. Then she\u2019ll continue to go back through and see if her memory has been prompted by any letters that were filled in or if an answer has \u201cjust come\u201d to her the second or third time around. Isaac likes to start with easier clue types, like fill-in-the-blanks or abbreviations.\n\nRachel Fabi, a Wordplay columnist, takes a different approach. \u201cI start every puzzle the same way: I start in the northwest and work my way through,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it\u2019ll be going back and forth between across and downs in the corner and then building off of what you have, until you have the whole thing.\u201d\n\nHave you gotten as far as you can?

          "text": "The regular season is over. The postseason is over. The real season is here.\n\nPerhaps \u201coffseason\u201d was apt earlier in baseball history. Now, the offseason is as fun as any other time in the baseball calendar. Be honest: Do you actually play the games in The Show or OOTP? Or do you sim the season \u2014 with a break for late July, of course \u2014 just to get to the fun part of building a new roster?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is your landing page for the 2023-24 MLB offseason. It\u2019s our Free Agent Big Board, comprised of our top 40 rankings (a composite of individual rankings by Keith Law, Tim Britton, Aaron Gleeman, Eno Sarris and Jim Bowden), stats breakdowns, contract projections, best fits and more. And whenever any player signs, check back here for instant analysis \u2014 how the fit works for the player and the team \u2014 all offseason long.\n\nWhile this isn\u2019t the deepest free-agent class, it makes up for it with star power and intrigue. Shohei Ohtani should break records for overall guarantee and/or average annual value in his next contract. Yoshinobu Yamamoto might be the best pitcher to ever move from Nippon Professional Baseball in Japan to the major leagues. Aaron Nola has been one of the sport\u2019s best and most durable starters for a half-decade and Cody Bellinger is one of its streakiest talents.\n\nAnd the number of teams looking to make an offseason statement is higher than ever. Teams accustomed to spending big (and often winning big) had down seasons in 2023 in New York (both the Bronx and Queens), Boston, St. Louis and San Francisco. The Dodgers saved up for this offseason with a quiet winter last year and are coming off another playoff disappointment.\n\nBecause here\u2019s the thing: Free agency really matters in baseball. The Rangers just spent October hammering home how successful, not to mention how fun, the return on major free-agent investment can be.\n\nSome bookkeeping: The player\u2019s listed age is how old he\u2019ll be on June 30 of next season (and thus what age he\u2019s considered for the full season), the stats are from the 2023 season, the WAR is from FanGraphs, the best fits are alphabetical and you can filter through by position or search by name.\n\nBookmark, star, Ctrl/Cmd+D depending on your preference, and check back in all winter.

As a hitter from 2021-23, his .964 OPS was No. 2 in MLB behind only Aaron Judge. As a pitcher during that same period, his 2.84 ERA and strikeout rate of 11.4 per nine innings each ranked third for starters with at least 400 innings. Ohtani is unlike anything MLB has ever seen, with a legit case for being a top-five hitter and a top-five pitcher, which is absolutely bonkers. In the past three seasons, he produced 26.5 fWAR \u2014 15.5 as a hitter and 11.0 as a pitcher \u2014 a mind-bending total that breaks down to roughly $70 million a year in strictly on-field value. He\u2019s all but assured of securing the largest contract in MLB history. Buckle up. Team Outlook Single Double Triple Homer Lorem ipsum...This is where the text goes Data: fWAR from FanGraphs Britton's projection 12 years, $520 million Best fits LAD, NYM, SEA, SF Staff rankings 1 Law 1 Britton 1 Gleeman 1 Sarris 1 Bowden 3 year fWAR DH RHP SP 2 Aaron Nola 7 years $172 mil Profile Age 31 Position RHP, SP Last team Philadelphia Phillies Innings pitched 193 2/3 ERA+ 96 Over the last six seasons, Nola ranks first in the sport in games started, second in innings, third in strikeouts, and 15th in FIP (among pitchers with 100 starts). He has pitched at close to an ace level over that time, and he has been available all of that time. His last missed start due to injury was in May 2017. The rub for Nola is that, in two of the last three seasons, his ERA has been worse than the league average. When he struggled in 2021, Nola\u2019s peripheral stats suggested a bounceback was coming; he complied in 2022 to earn a fourth-place finish in the National League Cy Young Award voting. His peripherals aren\u2019t as rosy this year as they were then, although they are still better than league average. His strikeout rate is down a bit, and his walk rate moved back up after a career best last season. He served up a career-high 32 home runs in 2023. Player Outlook Single Double Triple Homer This is a no-brainer for Nola, who stays with the team that drafted him in 2014 and gets roughly $25 million per year through age 37 despite coming off a 4.46 ERA season. Seven years is the longest deal for a free-agent pitcher since Gerrit Cole and Stephen Strasburg in the 2019-2020 offseason, and Jacob deGrom (five years and $185 million last offseason) is the only free-agent starter to sign for more total money since then. \u2014 Aaron Gleeman Team Outlook Single Double Triple Homer Dave Dombrowski doesn\u2019t mess around. Contracts this big aren\u2019t normally signed this early in free agency, but Dombrowski doesn\u2019t care about normal when it comes to adding and keeping stars. Nola is now the Phillies\u2019 seventh player with an average annual salary of at least $20 million, joining Trea Turner, Bryce Harper, Zack Wheeler, J.T. Realmuto, Nick Castellanos and Kyle Schwarber. The Athletic'sTim Britton had projected a six-year, $180 million deal.\u2014 Aaron Gleeman Data: fWAR from FanGraphs Contract Details 7 years, $172 mil Staff rankings 3 Law 3 Britton 2 Gleeman 2 Sarris 4 Bowden 3 year fWAR RHP SP 3 Yoshinobu Yamamoto Staff rankings 4 Law 2 Britton 3 Gleeman 4 Sarris 2 Bowden Profile Age 25 Position RHP, SP Last team Orix Buffaloes (NPB) Innings pitched 171 ERA+ NPB Yamamoto will be the most prized pitcher on the open market for two reasons. First, he\u2019s posted better results in Nippon Professional Baseball than any pitcher who\u2019s ever signed in the majors. Second, he\u2019s only 25, making him an appealing option for teams that are both looking to win right away in 2024 and toward a sustained window of competitiveness beyond next year. Yamamoto has won the last three Eiji Sawamura awards \u2014 Japan\u2019s version of the Cy Young Award \u2014 and twice been named the Pacific League\u2019s most valuable player. Yamamoto works with a fastball that sits in the mid-90s and touches higher. His best secondary pitch is a splitter that dives off the table, and he utilizes an unorthodox grip on a tight curveball. Yamamoto has struck out opposing hitters about 50 percent more than the league average in Japan. A team signing Yamamoto will be subjected to a posting fee, paying 20 percent of the first $25 million, 17.5 percent of the next $25 million, and 15 percent of anything over $50 million.

After a pair of bewilderingly poor seasons, Bellinger returned to being one of the game\u2019s premier players in 2023 on a pillow contract with the Cubs. He was the linchpin to an improved Chicago offense, propelling it into contention during one otherworldly stretch this summer and overall posting his best numbers since his MVP campaign in 2019 while patrolling center field most of the time. Bellinger is still only entering his age-28 season, and his ceiling is as a superstar capable of pairing top-flight offense with standout defense at a premium position. There\u2019s no other position player available in this market that can claim that. Bellinger has also shown a lower floor than most any free agent who\u2019s signed for the kind of deal he may land this winter, and his batted-ball data suggested his offensive results last season may have outpaced his input. Data: fWAR from FanGraphs Britton's projection 6 years, $162 million Best fits BOS, CHC, NYY, SF Staff rankings 2 Law 4 Britton 5 Gleeman 5 Sarris 6 Bowden 3 year fWAR CF 1B 5 Blake Snell Staff rankings 7 Law 5 Britton 4 Gleeman 3 Sarris 5 Bowden Profile Age 31 Position LHP, SP Last team San Diego Padres Innings pitched 180 ERA+ 182 Few pitchers have hit free agency coming off as dominant a stretch as Snell put together in his walk year: From the end of May on, he compiled a 1.20 ERA over 23 starts, blanking the opposition in 11 of those outings (and only twice allowing more than two runs). He is likely to claim his second Cy Young Award later this month and thus become just the seventh pitcher to win the award in both leagues. But \u201cwalk year\u201d was an apt way of describing Snell\u2019s season in multiple ways. He posted those remarkable results while also leading the league in walks; the last Cy Young Award winner to do that was Early Wynn in 1959. Because he goes to so many full counts, Snell rarely works beyond the sixth inning and averaged fewer than 5 2/3 innings per start this season.

Getting ground balls with his sinker, and whiffs with curveballs and changeups, he joined Gerrit Cole and Kevin Gausman as the only pitchers with 30-plus starts and a sub-4.00 ERA in each of the past three seasons. Like most southpaws, Montgomery is death on left-handed hitters, but he also uses good command and two quality off-speed pitches to neutralize righties. It\u2019s not the sexiest profile for a pitcher set to cash in big at age 31, but Montgomery is a quality second or third option in a contending rotation and figures to be a lot of teams\u2019 top fallback plan in a relatively shallow market for starters.

Gerrit Cole was the only pitcher in either league to throw more innings with a lower ERA, and Gray has a 3.22 ERA in 124 total starts since leaving the Yankees after 2018. Much of his 2023 success can be traced to allowing just eight homers, a rate of 0.4 per nine innings that led MLB and was roughly half of his career rate. He deserves credit for that, but it\u2019s also not sustainable. Any team signing Gray can expect more homers, and shouldn\u2019t bank on getting more than 400 or so innings on a three-year deal, but he\u2019s an established playoff-caliber starter with a deep pitch mix.

He had a monster April, hitting .384 with a 1.152 OPS. But then after May 1, he batted .205 with a .659 OPS in 113 games, including a sub-.650 OPS in four of the last five months. Soon to be 31, and with his last .800 OPS season in 2020, it\u2019s fair to wonder if his days of being an impact bat are over. His fielding remains elite, combining exceptional range with the arm strength and aggression to get outs on plays other third basemen wouldn\u2019t even attempt. Suitors offering Chapman big long-term deals will need to feel certain his defense will age gracefully. If it does, even being an average-ish hitter with 20-homer power would make him an All-Star-caliber all-around player.

And despite personal reasons and injuries limiting him to 17 and 26 starts, opting out became a no-brainer for the 31-year-old lefty after posting a 3.58 ERA with Detroit. He should have little issue surpassing the three years and $49 million left on his original deal. Rodriguez sets batters up with his fastball and cutter, and puts them away with his trusty changeup, which allows him to neutralize righty bats better than most lefties. His lack of durability, time away from the Tigers in 2022 and headline-making veto of a midseason trade to the Dodgers could suppress Rodriguez\u2019s market somewhat, but he\u2019s a playoff-caliber lefty in a weaker free-agent starter class than last time.

Over his last month as a Brewer and first as a Padre, Hader allowed 25 runs in 15 innings. Remove that stretch from his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and Hader owns a 1.96 ERA over the past six seasons, a stretch of remarkable dominance. Yes, his strikeout rate is down from the ridiculous high-40s rates he ran back in 2018 and 2019 to merely one of the top five in the sport, and his walk rate in 2023 was a new career worst. Under the hood, there are some reasons to be concerned that Hader can be as good as he has been, broadly, up to this point. But how many relievers would you trust more in a ninth inning right now than Hader? You\u2019re probably not counting on a second hand, and you may not be using all the fingers on the first.

He\u2019d make only nine starts after that point, and he\u2019d post an even 9.00 ERA in those starts. A lot of that can probably be attributed to first a hip and then a rib-cage injury that knocked Stroman out of action for six weeks and meant an initial return to the bullpen in September as he built back up. However, it\u2019s the second straight season in which injuries have limited Stroman to fewer than 140 innings total, and his performance when on the field has been a step back from what it was during his best years with the Blue Jays and Mets. His walk rate in 2023 was a career high. Still, as long as he\u2019s healthy, Stroman should pitch in the top half of a rotation.

Imanaga was not quite as dominant in 2023 as he had been in 2022; nevertheless, over the past three seasons his ERA in NPB has been about 38 percent better than the league average there.

Until that point, Hoskins had been a steady and productive presence in the middle of the Philadelphia order, consistently posting an OPS+ around 125 and approaching 30 homers each season. The knee injury creates some questions, but maybe fewer than it would if Hoskins were expected to patrol, say, center field. He should still be able to play first base, and in a bad free-agent market for position players, he\u2019s a guy who can fit a lot of different rosters \u2014 contending teams in need of a middle-of-the-order bat, teams coming up that could use a veteran presence, rebuilding teams looking to flip someone at the deadline for prospects.

Candelario hopes that translates into a similar multiyear payday. While the primary statistics were right in line or better with his production in 2021 or the abbreviated 2020 season, Candelario\u2019s underlying metrics were a little less positive this time around. Still, that\u2019s three seasons in the past four he\u2019s delivered solid if not quite spectacular results while playing a decent third base. For a team with a need on either corner of the infield, Candelario is a strong option behind Matt Chapman.

Giolito still missed plenty of bats, but he served up a whopping 41 homers in 184 1/3 innings. At age 29, he\u2019s one of the most obvious rebound candidates among prominent free agents. Giolito received Cy Young Award votes in 2019, 2020 and 2021, and his strikeout and walk rates have slipped only slightly since then. But any team willing to spend big money on Giolito for multiple years must be sure his once-excellent changeup is still a potential weapon rather than just part of the homer-allowing problem.

After altering his repertoire as a Ray in 2021, Wacha has seen significantly better results over the past two seasons with Boston and San Diego. He\u2019s gone 25-6 in that time, throwing about 130 innings each season with an ERA 27 percent better than the league average. Wacha has pitched for five different teams over the past five years.

Lugo\u2019s carrying pitch has always been his curveball, an early Statcast darling because of its absurd spin rate. But he owns a broad mix that included a slider he was working on as last season progressed. Lugo\u2019s relative lack of innings leading into 2023 can be looked at as a positive (his arm is far fresher than most guys at 34) or a negative (how does his arm recover from the increased workload).

The power is no fluke: Soler hits the ball as hard as most anyone in the sport, and as often. The downsides are just as clear.

But his right-handed power and plate discipline make an undeniable impact whenever, and wherever, he\u2019s in the lineup. His combined .826 OPS since 2021 is 19th among right-handed hitters, sandwiched between Xander Bogaerts and Nolan Arenado. Garver started just 41 games behind the plate in two seasons with Texas, including only one start there after Sept. 1 last season.

Stephenson had a 4.91 career ERA before the deal. Tampa Bay tweaked Stephenson\u2019s oft-used slider into a more cutter-like offering he threw nearly 70 percent of the time, with amazing results. He\u2019s always thrown hard and missed plenty of bats, so Stephenson\u2019s breakout wasn\u2019t totally out of nowhere, but teams will have to weigh four great months versus a mediocre track record. He has one of the widest spectrums of possible outcomes in this free-agent class.

Belt was really good, and generally overlooked, drawing walks in bunches, hitting for power and posting an .858 OPS that ranked seventh among AL hitters with at least 100 games. But he also played only 103 games due to hamstring and back injuries. Belt last played at least 120 games in 2019, which is the only time in the past seven years he\u2019s topped 500 plate appearances. When healthy, he remains a strong middle-of-the-order bat, especially when spotted mostly versus right-handers, and Belt shook off any age-related worries by playing his best down the stretch \u2026 until a mid-September injured list stint. At age 36, he\u2019s a high-end one-year solution.

His strikeout rate during five seasons with the Guardians was 10.0 per nine innings, but that\u2019s dropped to 7.5 and 7.2 the past two seasons, along with a predictable increase in homers allowed. That leaves Clevinger looking more like a mid-rotation starter than a front-line arm at age 33, but he doesn\u2019t offer as much durability as teams generally prefer in those spots, topping 135 innings just once, in 2018. Clevinger\u2019s fastball-slider combo can still get plenty of outs, and his changeup showed signs of improvement in 2023, but fly-ball pitchers with below-average strikeout rates have little margin for error.

And for just the second time since 2017, his OPS was also above the league average, making Kiermaier a tremendous all-around value on a one-year, $9 million contract even while playing only 129 games (tied for his most since 2015). Contending teams should be lining up for a chance to sign him to a similar deal this offseason, but Kiermaier may have played his way into multi-year offers. Counting on more above-average hitting isn\u2019t safe, and even the great up-the-middle fielders can\u2019t fight off aging forever, but Kiermaier\u2019s speed, reaction time and arm strength have shown no signs of decline.

He had his best season since 2019 with the Rays; you may remember Blake Snell\u2019s disappointed reaction (and colorful phrasing) when Pham was dealt that offseason to San Diego. Seasons like Pham\u2019s for a 35-year-old are more often dead-cat bounces than full-on revivals. Pham, however, could argue that a late-spring change in contact lenses was a primary driver of his on-field improvement and thus a reason it can be sustained. (He has keratoconus, an eye condition that can blur vision.) A year after his strikeout rate spiked and his walk rate plunged, Pham brought both back closer to his career norms. Pham\u2019s also known throughout the sport for his diligent work ethic and voice in the clubhouse.

He never seemed right after spraining his knee in mid-April, returning four weeks later to hit just .240 with one homer and a .567 OPS in his final 112 games. It was a shocking collapse for a 30-year-old coming off four straight seasons hitting above .300. Anderson\u2019s value has always revolved around batting average, because he swings at everything and has middling power, which makes last season\u2019s jump in strikeout rate especially worrisome. His fielding metrics have also declined sharply, perhaps forcing a move away from shortstop that would put even more pressure on his bat bouncing back. Anderson is a big name with upside, but there are red flags galore.

Sure enough, he was very quickly on the move, going to the Rangers on June 30 and spending the second half (and postseason) in a setup role. And at age 35, he was able to halt a multi-year stuff and performance decline. Chapman\u2019s fastball averaged 99.0 mph, his best velocity since his first season with the Yankees in 2017, and he racked up 103 strikeouts in 58 1/3 innings for his best rate since 2020. His control is shaky enough at this point that Chapman can be counted on to simply melt down several times a season, but his overall level of dominance, and ability to get whiffs on four pitches, is still nearly unmatched ahead of Year 15.

At age 37, he\u2019ll almost surely be relegated to the one-year flier aisle of free agency, likely slotting into the back of a contender\u2019s rotation. Last season\u2019s 88.6 mph average fastball velocity was one of the lowest among all starters, but even at his best (and healthiest) Ryu barely threw over 90. He succeeds now largely the same way he did then, by living dangerously in the strike zone and combatting right-handed hitters with changeups and occasional curveballs. But his margin for error is thinner than ever, calling into question Ryu\u2019s remaining upside.

Over the last two years with the Dodgers and Phillies, he has reasserted himself as, if not one of the game\u2019s most historically dominant closers, at least a capable closer for a winning team. Kimbrel\u2019s gotten back to himself by reining in a walk rate that had climbed to untenable heights. (It\u2019s still not ideal.) He needs to be able to command his fastball in the zone to generate chase with his all-world curveball. At 36, he\u2019s probably back in the market for another one-year deal, again appealing to good teams with a high-leverage need late.

Not bad for a guy released by the Cubs entering what would have been the final year of his eight-year contract with the club. Heyward has long been known for his defense and his leadership. He\u2019s a useful player when his offense is right around league average, let alone above it the way it was in 2023. Even as he\u2019ll be 34 next season, he can do more than stand in center field and he remains a very good defender in the corners.

It may seem like he should still be in the middle of his peak, but Merrifield was a late bloomer, debuting for the Royals at age 27. Now he\u2019s 35 and hasn\u2019t posted an OPS above league average since 2020, with declining speed and fielding flexibility. He\u2019s still fast, but Merrifield\u2019s sprint speed has dropped from the 94th percentile to the 85th percentile. He led the league by going 40-for-44 on steals in 2021, but he\u2019s 42-for-57 in 284 games since, in part because he\u2019s no longer as able to get on base. Merrifield remains a high-end role player capable of manning second base and all three outfield spots, but he\u2019s no longer an everyday, top-of-the-lineup asset.

He looked poised to play a significant role down the stretch for the defending pennant-winners in the National League, and then cash in this winter having proven his bona fides as a starter. Instead, he made just five more starts for Philadelphia, with an ERA approaching eight across them, and got shifted to the pen for the rest of September and October. Since shifting back to the rotation in 2022, Lorenzen\u2019s ERA is a hair better than league average, with a strikeout rate well below. He did really improve his walk rate and the effectiveness of the fastball, which is to say there are tools here for a pitcher with less wear on his arm than most at 32.

          "text": "While the hostage negotiations between Israel and Hamas have continued, the Israeli military hasn\u2019t let up on airstrikes in Gaza. Here, the northern Gaza Strip on Wednesday.\n\nThe temporary cease-fire paired with the release of hostages held in Gaza and Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails will likely not begin until Friday at the earliest, Israeli officials said on Wednesday night, as negotiators continued to hammer out details of an agreement between Israel and Hamas that would see a pause in fighting to allow for groups of hostages and Palestinian prisoners to be released.\n\nThe new timing for the releases came in a statement issued by the National Security Council through the Israeli prime minister\u2019s office, and appeared to rule out the possibility that hostages could be freed on Thursday, as many of their families had hoped.\n\nThe timing on the cease-fire was disclosed by an Israeli official, speaking on the condition of anonymity about the highly sensitive issue.\n\nThe new information underscored the fluidity of the negotiations between Israel and Hamas, which are being mediated by Qatar.\n\nThe two sides have not announced specific plans for an exchange of at least 150 Palestinian women and children jailed by Israel for at least 50 Israeli women and children held in Gaza, including exactly when people would begin being released and who would be included.\n\nThe Israeli military also said that it \u201ccontinued to fight in the Gaza Strip,\u201d highlighting that the agreement to pause the fighting was not yet in place.\n\nAt a news conference on Wednesday night, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the agreement for a temporary cease-fire was a step toward Israel\u2019s objective of freeing all of the captives held in Gaza, and that Israel intended to continue its military campaign. \u201cI want to be clear: the war continues,\u201d he said.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know:\n\nHamas and Israel still disagree on how many captives are being held in Gaza, making it hard to work out who exactly will be released, according to four Israeli officials who spoke anonymously to discuss a sensitive matter.\n\nThe Israeli government said in a statement that the hostages would be released in four phases during the pause in fighting, with at least 10 hostages released at each stage.\n\nIsrael published a shortlist of 300 Palestinians who could be released from Israeli jails, but had yet to narrow the list to 150 names.\n\nThe pause would allow for an increase in humanitarian aid to Gaza, through both the Egyptian and Israeli borders. But there is not yet agreement on the amount of supplies that would be allowed through, according to a fifth Israeli official.\n\nIsraeli officials have confirmed that the Israeli air force will not fly over southern Gaza during the temporary cease-fire, and will have a six-hour daily window in which there will be no flights in the northern end of the territory.\n\nHamas and its allies in Gaza captured about 240 hostages during their raid on southern Israel on Oct. 7, during which they killed an estimated 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials. Israel has responded with thousands of airstrikes and by invading Gaza with ground forces, killing more than 12,000 people in the fighting, according to health officials in the Hamas-controlled territory.\n\nIf the multiday pause holds, it would be the longest halt in hostilities since the start of the 47-day war. But with no third party on the ground to secure the deal, it could easily break down, like many other cease-fire deals in the long history of the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nHamas said in a statement on Wednesday that while it had agreed to a truce, \u201cour hands will remain on the trigger.\u201d\n\nAnd Israeli officials have said that their war in Gaza will continue once the pause ends.\n\nIsabel Kershner , Gabby Sobelman and Rawan Sheikh Ahmad contributed reporting.",

They are desperate for any signs their loved ones are alive. Some say they barely sleep.

A 3-year-old whose last memory of her parents was seeing them both murdered. And an infant, now all of 10 months, who has spent about a tenth of his life in captivity.\n\nThey are among the more than 30 children abducted from their homes and taken to Gaza during the Hamas-led assault on southern Israel on Oct. 7. Their faces have appeared on signs at marches in Israel and on fliers posted in cities around the world. And their plight has both galvanized a nation at war and forced Israel\u2019s leaders to negotiate, albeit indirectly, with Hamas, the armed group they have vowed to destroy.\n\nAbout 240 people were abducted by gunmen that day. Among them were individuals gravely injured in the attack or who suffered from chronic illnesses, infants and grandparents, peace activists and soldiers, citizens of Israel and foreign nationals.\n\n\u201cEach one of them is a person, not a number or a statistic,\u201d said Eylon Keshet, a cousin of Kfir Bibas, the now 10-month-old. \u201cEach one is a part of our lives and has dreams and ambitions.\u201d\n\nImage Kfir Bibas, right, with his father, Yarden, left, his mother, Shiri, right, and brother, Ariel, 4, center. All were taken hostage. Credit... via Bibas family\n\nThe captive children, especially, have had an immeasurable emotional impact on the traumatized country. Their fate has put the hostages at the center of the national agenda, complicating the military\u2019s war strategy in Gaza and dividing the government about whether a deal to secure the release of at least 50 captives goes far enough and if the agreed pause in fighting would spell a premature end of the war and leave Hamas intact.\n\nAt least 36 children and teenagers, ranging in age from infancy to the final year of high school, are being held in Gaza. Now, for the first time since the war began, a deal to release dozens of the hostages is at hand, raising the hopes of the nation but creating a special kind of agony for the families desperate to learn if their relatives will be among those freed. Almost a day after the deal was announced, the families had yet to receive any information from the authorities.\n\n\u201cI am feeling like yesterday and the day before, only worse,\u201d said Yael Engel Lichi, the aunt of Ofir Engel, a 12th-grader kidnapped on Oct. 7 from Kibbutz Be\u2019eri while visiting his girlfriend.\n\n\u201cWe are at the point of collapse,\u201d she added.\n\nSome, but perhaps not all, of the children are expected to be among the first hostages released in the coming days under a deal announced on Wednesday. The publicized details of the agreement include a brief pause in fighting and the phased release of at least 50 hostages in exchange for 150 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.\n\nImage Ofir Engel, a 12th grader, with his girlfriend. Credit... via Engel Family\n\nLittle is known about the children\u2019s whereabouts or well-being, and Hamas, the dominant Palestinian force in Gaza, has denied the Red Cross access to them. It is presumed that some are being held beneath Gaza\u2019s streets in the group\u2019s warren of tunnels and underground chambers.\n\nYocheved Lifshitz, 85, who was among just four hostages released by Hamas early in the conflict, described being marched into a network of damp subterranean tunnels under Gaza that she likened to \u201ca spider web.\u201d\n\nHamas has said that it does not hold all the captives, raising questions about its ability to free everyone. Islamic Jihad, another armed group in Gaza, released the hostage video of Yagil Yaakov, 12, who was captured along with his brother Or, 16.",

          "text": "When it was all said and done, the deal to release some of the hostages held by Hamas came down to two critical phone calls ultimately forcing each side to make a tough concession.\n\nThe Israelis were insisting that it was not enough to free just 50 of the roughly 240 hostages. They had to have more, they said. At that point, President Biden had to talk Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel into accepting what was on the table and then keep working to recover the rest.\n\nAs for Hamas, according to senior administration officials, its leaders were demanding that the pause in fighting incorporated into the agreement last five days, even though the Israelis refused to agree to more than four. Mr. Biden told the emir of Qatar, who was serving as the intermediary with Hamas, that four was all they would get for now.\n\nThe path to the hostage deal was painful and painstaking, one marked by fitful progress, deep mistrust, terrible choices and moments when the whole thing was on the verge of unraveling. Neither side got exactly what it wanted. But if the agreement is carried out successfully over the next few days \u2014 and that is still an important if \u2014 it could serve as a template for further negotiations to free more of the hostages and extend the temporary cease-fire.\n\n\u201cLast night\u2019s deal is a testament to the tireless diplomacy and determination of many dedicated individuals across the United States government to bring Americans home,\u201d Mr. Biden said on Wednesday on X, the platform formerly called Twitter. \u201cNow, it\u2019s important that all aspects are fully implemented.\u201d\n\nThis account is based on senior Biden administration officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid disrupting the channels of communication.\n\nThe effort to free the hostages extends back to the hours following the terrorist attack of Oct. 7, when Hamas gunmen killed about 1,200 people and captured the other 240.\n\nShortly after the attack, the government of Qatar, a small Gulf emirate that hosts some Hamas leaders but maintains close relations with the United States, approached the White House with information about the hostages and suggested the possibility of a deal to win their release. The Qataris asked that a small group of U.S. officials work secretly with them and the Israelis.\n\nJake Sullivan, the president\u2019s national security adviser, directed Brett McGurk, the White House Middle East coordinator, and Joshua Geltzer, then the deputy homeland security adviser who has since become the top lawyer for the National Security Council, to take the lead. To preserve secrecy, other agencies were kept in the dark about the initiative.\n\nMr. McGurk, who has wide contacts in the region, held early morning phone calls each day with the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, and then briefed Mr. Sullivan, who kept Mr. Biden informed. Mr. Sullivan stayed in touch with Ron Dermer and Tzachi Hanegbi, two of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s closest advisers.",
