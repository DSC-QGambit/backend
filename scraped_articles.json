Please review the episode audio before quoting from this transcript and email transcripts@nytimes.com with any questions.\n\nmeribah knight\n\nDo you remember what year it was that you were arrested and jailed?\n\nspeaker 1 I was so young that I don\u2019t even remember what was going on in that time. [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nmeribah knight\n\nYeah. Right. And so you were \u2014 how old were you?\n\nspeaker 1 Seven.\n\nmeribah knight\n\nOh, my god. When Brandon was just seven years old, police showed up at his door to arrest him. Brandon\u2019s offense? Tagging along with his older brothers who\u2019d wrestled in a vacant duplex and left some holes in the drywall. Now police were there to take Brandon and his brothers to the juvenile detention center, jail, basically.\n\nspeaker 1 My mom said that they weren\u2019t going to take me in. But they were like, well, he needs to learn his lesson.\n\nmeribah knight\n\nBrandon was held in detention overnight and then brought to the juvenile court for his hearing.\n\nspeaker 1 They had me in shackles, from our feet to our arms, going into court.\n\nmeribah knight\n\nBrandon should have gone home with his mom that day. But when he went before the judge, she sent him back to jail for a week. Brandon\u2019s arrest and detention happened in Rutherford County, Tennessee. And his case wasn\u2019t unique there. For over a decade, the county was arresting and jailing kids for even the most minor offenses.\n\nspeaker 2 I didn\u2019t want to go to school. speaker 3 I just ran away. speaker 4 I spray painted a penis on a wall.\n\nmeribah knight\n\nIt happened so often, to so many kids in Rutherford County, that getting sent to juvenile detention was almost a rite of passage. In many cases, what it also was was illegal. This is the story of how that system came to be, how it came to be normalized, accepted, lauded even. It\u2019s also the story of two insiders who actually did see the problem in Rutherford County.\n\nspeaker 5 We would sit out, and smoke a cigarette, and say, we\u2019re going to burn this place to the ground. [LAUGHS]\n\nmeribah knight\n\nThey just needed other people to see it, too. From Serial Productions and the New York Times, I\u2019m Meribah Knight. And this is The Kids of Rutherford County, coming October 26.",
