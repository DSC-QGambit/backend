          "text": "A plan by Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) would redirect excess profits from multinational corporations allowed to remain open during the Chinese coronavirus crisis to small businesses that have been forced to close due to economic shutdowns.\n\nGabbard released legislation on Friday, known as the Pandemic Crisis Excess Profits Tax, to ensure that corporations such as Amazon, Facebook, Walmart, and Google are not profiting off economic shutdowns that have helped clear the market of their competition.\n\n\u201cBig tech corporations and big-box retailers are among those who have made excessive profits during the COVID-19 pandemic, while mom and pop shops are being forced to close their doors due to government-mandated restrictions,\u201d Gabbard said in a statement.\n\nThe legislation \u2014 first adopted during World War I and World War II to prevent corporations from profiting off the wars \u2014 would add a 95 percent tax on corporations\u2019 excess profits calculated by subtracting their 2020 gross earnings from their average gross earnings from 2016 to 2019, before the coronavirus.\n\nBig tech & big box retailers are seeing windfall profits & will emerge from this crisis stronger than ever at the expense of small businesses who are bearing the brunt of gov restrictions. I introduced HRes 1267 that will tax 95% of excess profits to support small businesses\u2026 pic.twitter.com/XjCKazW30d \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard \ud83c\udf3a (@TulsiGabbard) December 18, 2020\n\nThe corporations\u2019 excess profits would then be directed to aid struggling small businesses that have been forced to close their doors due to economic shutdowns while giant conglomerates have been allowed to conduct business as usual. Gabbard said:\n\nBecause of this, these large corporations will be better positioned with a competitive advantage over small businesses in a post-pandemic economy. Congress must reinstate the WWII-era excess profit tax used at that time to prevent war-time profiteering, and dedicate the funds collected to helping small businesses recover.\n\n\u201cSmall businesses are the backbone of our economy and have borne the brunt of this crisis,\u201d Gabbard continued. \u201cWe need to support our small businesses and make sure that they are able to thrive and compete.\u201d\n\nWhile potentially 160,000 to 317,000 small businesses across the United States have closed between February and September of this year as a result of forced economic shutdowns due to the coronavirus. That amounts to roughly 800 to 1,200 small business closures every day.\n\nMeanwhile, the executives of the nation\u2019s biggest corporations \u2014 allowed to remain open \u2014 have netted enormous profits over the last year.\n\nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos, for instance, has increased his wealth by nearly $72.5 billion this year, while Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has increased his wealth by $26.3 billion. Big box retailers like Walmart, Target, Home Depot, and Wayfair have seen their profits surge as their competitors are run out of business.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

          "text": "Breitbart News\u2019s AWR Hawkins was awarded \u201cGun Rights Defender of the Year\u201d by the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms (CCRKBA).\n\nThe award came in conjunction with the 2020 Gun Rights Policy Conference, a Second Amendment Foundation-sponsored event that brings together pro-gun authors, broadcasters, journalists, legislators, and enthusiasts annually.\n\nThe policy conference was held in September of this year, but was conducted virtually because of coronavirus restrictions. Awards, normally given during the conference, are being announced during December 2020 via press releases.\n\nOn December 17, 2020, CCRKBA announced they were giving Hawkins the \u201cGun Rights Defender of the Year\u201d award.\n\n\u201cAWR is a gun rights legend,\u201d Alex Marlow, editor-in-chief of Breitbart News, said. \u201cFor years he has kept tens of millions of Breitbart readers on the cutting edge on one of the most important issues of our time. It\u2019s great to see him recognized for his tireless work. He\u2019s a true happy warrior.\u201d\n\nCCRKBA chairman Alan Gottlieb said, \u201cAWR Hawkins is one of the more powerful voices in the Second Amendment community. He has worked tirelessly offering news and views from a pro-Second Amendment perspective, and his background certainly enables him to speak with authority on gun rights and military history.\u201d\n\nHawkins has a Masters in U.S. History, with a focus on the Civil War. He has a PhD in Military History, with a focus on the Vietnam War and the U.S. Navy.\n\nHawkins received the \u201cJournalist of the Year\u201d award at the 2015 Gun Rights Policy Conference, \u201cGun Rights Defender of the Year\u201d at the 2016 conference, \u201cJournalist of the Year\u201d at the 2017 conference, and received that award again in 2019.\n\nUpon being notified of this year\u2019s award, Hawkins said, \u201cIt\u2019s awesome to get this award, and it\u2019s an honor to defend the Second Amendment and gun rights. Without those we don\u2019t have freedom.\u201d",

          "text": "Joseph R. Biden has not even been sworn in and already it is shaping up to be the \u201chold my beer\u201d presidency.\n\nFor four years the innocent citizens of America have endured the wildest accusations and conspiracies about how President Trump was corrupt, a puppet of a foreign power, beholden to an overseas dictator hellbent on destroying America whose family was raking in the millions from those very same enemies abroad.\n\nMr. Biden\u2019s response: \u201cHold my beer.\u201d\n\nAs in, \u201cHold my beer. Watch this.\u201d It\u2019s the age-old anthem among rednecks across America who wish to outdo their comrades in some daring \u2014 often self-defeating \u2014 stunt.\n\nFor example, you might build a wooden ramp beside a raging bonfire over which you jump your brand new four-wheeler. \u201cHold my beer. Watch this,\u201d says your friend, who douses the wooden ramp in diesel fuel and lights it on fire before performing the same brilliant stunt.\n\n\u201cHold my beer. Watch this,\u201d is said to be the five most perilous words in the American language.\n\nBut, hey, the beaches of Normandy did not get stormed by a bunch of sissies.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t mean to give Mr. Biden too much credit here. The guy wouldn\u2019t know which end was up on a four-wheeler. He wouldn\u2019t know diesel fuel from the apple juice his caretakers give him in a box with a straw.\n\nHis wife, \u201cDoctor\u201d Jill Biden, would be utterly flummoxed by the math of a four-wheeler. She would be looking for the fifth wheel, while demanding everyone standing around the bonfire and burning ramp address her as \u201cDoctor.\u201d\n\nBut when it comes to being a flaming disaster, Mr. Biden is an expert. He has been getting everything disastrously wrong in Washington for five decades now.\n\nAll the accusations of corruption and international conspiracy lodged against Mr. Trump turned out to be pure fantasy.\n\nBeleaguered American taxpayers shelled out tens of millions of dollars investigating the president\u2019s supposed ties to Russia only to discover they were just overheated fever dreams of swamp dwellers suffering acute strains of Trump Derangement Syndrome.\n\nSlow Joe and his dim wife never got that memo.\n\nInstead, Mr. Biden said, \u201cHold my beer.\u201d He anointed himself \u201cthe big guy\u201d and dispatched his troubled son Hunter to China to collect millions and put the whole family into political hock to the Chinese communists.\n\nClaims of corruption against Mr. Trump proved so unfounded, Democrats dropped those charges in their madcap impeachment proceedings, instead of impeaching him over a perfectly legitimate phone call to the president of Ukraine \u2014 allegedly some kind of \u201cquid pro quo\u201d that was in some way somehow evil or corrupt.\n\nTo which Mr. Biden \u2014 again \u2014 replied: \u201cHold my beer.\u201d\n\nHe leveraged $1 billion in taxpayer money to force the sacking of a Ukraine prosecutor who was threatening to investigate his son\u2019s obvious corruption in that derelict country.\n\nLike I said, flaming disaster.\n\nFor four years we have listened to Democrats complain that Mr. Trump is vulgar and working to divide the country.\n\n\u201cHold my beer,\u201d said Mr. Biden, who doesn\u2019t even try to conceal his contempt for the 75 million Americans who voted for Mr. Trump in this last election.\n\nAmong his latest hires is a guttermouth who spouts off to Glamour magazine about how they will attempt to work with Republicans even though, in her potty language, they are a \u201cbunch of f\u2013\u2014s.\u201d\n\nSo glamorous. How proud would you be if your son brought home that mouth to meet the family?\n\n\u2022 Charles Hurt is opinion editor of The Washington Times.

          "text": "In an interview with Fox and Friends, Acting Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner Mark Morgan said on Wednesday that the incoming Biden administration\u2019s policies on border security and the border wall signal that America\u2019s borders will be open to illegal migrants, drug cartels, and traffickers.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has promised to complete 450 miles of wall along the U.S. southern border with Mexico by the end of the calendar year, but President-elect Joe Biden has said he will not build \u201cone more foot\u201d of the wall.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very disturbing,\u201d Morgan said.\n\n\u201cRight now, if you look at what the Biden administration\u2019s policies are going to be, it\u2019s not just about stopping the construction of the border wall,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cIt\u2019s about providing amnesty to millions of people.\u201d\n\nHe said Biden may even reverse the Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) order to immediately return illegal border crossers back to their country of origin to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\n\n\u201cThat is not an immigration strategy, mark my words,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cThat is an open border strategy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the cartels and human smugglers already see that loud and clear and are already fueling perceptions that with a change in administrations, our borders are going to be wide open,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cIt is absolutely increasing illegal immigration right today.\u201d\n\nAs for stopping the wall\u2019s construction, Morgan said that would cost taxpayers \u201cbillions\u201d of dollars to cancel contracts and walk away from the massive stockpile of steel and concrete already purchased for the project.\n\nMorgan said because Congress has failed to legislate immigration reform, Trump has had to do much of his border security reform through executive order. And as president, Biden could reverse all of Trump\u2019s accomplishments.\n\n\u201cAnd if he does that, I\u2019m predicting right here on this show. If they do what they promise they\u2019re going to do \u2026 you will see another crisis on our border, and it will pale in comparison to what we saw last year,\u201d Morgan said, referring to the border crisis of thousands of migrants in caravans trying to gain entry into the United States.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, Morgan has been making the media rounds to warn against Biden\u2019s policies.\n\nBreitbart News reported even the pro-migration New York Times is acknowledging Joe Biden\u2019s policies are encouraging poor people to come to the United States.\n\n\u201cIf there is a perception of more-humane policies, you are likely to see an increase of arrivals at the border,\u201d T. Alexander Aleinikoff, the director of the New York-based Zolberg Institute on Migration and Mobility, told the NYT in a December 13 report, titled \u201cAs Biden Prepares to Take Office, a New Rush at the Border.\u201d\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter or send news tips to pstarr@breitbart.com.",

          "text": "President-elect Joe Biden has yet to appoint any prominent supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) to his incoming administration in the month and-a-half since the November 3 presidential election.\n\nThe list of his twenty or so hires, both for Senate-confirmed and White House staff roles, includes several long-time aides, many former Obama administration officials, and even one or two \u201cprogressives,\u201d such as California Attorney General Xavier Becerra.\n\nBut almost all of those named supported Biden in the Democratic Party presidential primary.\n\nOne rare exception is Rep.

          "text": "CNN\u2019s chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta on Friday during \u201cAnderson Cooper 360,\u201d accused President Donald Trump of \u201cchasing\u201d after a fever dream, which he said was being able to overturn the November 3 election results.\n\nGuest anchor John Berman said, \u201cWhen you think of the crisis this country is facing now, the public health, the economy, the huge cyberattack, the president is speaking out in about any of it in any meaningful, substantial way. Why is he fighting for a job that he does not seemingly want to do?\u201d\n\nAcosta said, \u201cI talked to a Trump adviser earlier this week who described the president as not whining not working. I think that essentiality sums it up. It\u2019s extraordinary because not only do we have this raging pandemic with thousands of lives lost every day, we also have this cyberattack, this Russian cyberattack on the U.S. government, that the president is still silent about this evening. We had multiple days in a row where the president is not getting out in front of the camera and addressing reporters. He would have had multiple opportunities if he wants them to not only speak out on the pandemic and encourage people to get out there and get vaccinations but also to warn Vladimir Putin to stay out of this federal government. He\u2019s just chosen not to do so.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cIt is alarming. You and I were talking about this previously this week. This is a president who has checked out. He does not seem to want to do the job anymore. He likes the fancy house behind me with the wreaths adorning the exterior and so on, but he does not want to do the work. There is a lot to be done. It\u2019s extraordinary. One would think if he\u2019s thinking about running in 2024 that he would want to go out there and lead the charge on the coronavirus pandemic, lead the charge in challenging Vladimir Putin on this cybersecurity hack. He\u2019s not doing it. I suspect, John because he\u2019s wrapped up in grief with this election and chasing after this fever dream that he somehow can still over overturn the election results when it\u2019s just not going to happen.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",

          "text": "On Friday\u2019s broadcast of Fox News Radio\u2019s \u201cFox Across America,\u201d Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT) said that Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) should testify before a congressional committee about his involvement with a suspected Chinese spy.\n\nDaines said, [relevant remarks begin around 12:10] \u201cLet\u2019s just start with the first step is to have him come clean about what really happened. He needs to get in front of a congressional committee, whether it\u2019s in a classified setting, or in a public setting and just come clean on what\u2019s going on. That\u2019s step one, and when he is not willing to tell the actual story, then there\u2019s a problem here. And so that \u2014 the facts need to come out and then the consequences will follow shortly after.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett",

          "text": "MSNBC political analyst Jason Johnson predicted Friday on \u201cDeadline\u201d that violence over Donald Trump losing the White House would increase.\n\nJohnson said, \u201cThis is just the beginning of how this is going to be. Senator Tuberville he abandoned Texas Tech. He leaves everything but not Trump-ism. He abandoned three different colleges but he\u2019s not abandoning Trump-ism. You still have Proud Boys who are marching through Washington D.C. and tearing down signs. The moment that Donald Trump is out of power, these groups will become more unhinged. The Republican Party is full of individuals, even if they don\u2019t believe the things at the core, are willing to placate and play with and galvanize these kinds of organizations.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cI think we\u2019re heading into an even darker period. Because if you don\u2019t have somebody at the head of this sort of collection of ants running in and out of this insane anthill of MAGA and nonsense of white nationalism, if there\u2019s no one to control them, if Donald Trump doesn\u2019t have anybody around him to say \u2018Hey, look this is a good idea or bad idea,\u2019 they will only get worse. He\u2019ll sit and stew and watch television every day and think about the fact he\u2019s not on \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 anymore, thing about the fact that nobody cares about him and that will enrage him and the other people supporting him. So yeah I think the Republican party is in for real soul-searching but right now a lot of them are still committed to Donald Trump and the violence we\u2019re going to see in the coming months will make this past summer look like a picnic. I\u2019m not happy about that. I\u2019m not enthusiastic about that but that\u2019s what I see happening and the violence we\u2019re seeing in the streets right now is just a preview.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe\u2019re talking Portland, we\u2019re talking the Midwest, and these people are empowered every single minute of every single day that they hear senators deny the legitimacy of Joe Biden getting into office. They\u2019re not being crushed down they are being empowered. Look at the two people running for the January 5 runoff. They are encouraging this kind of behavior. This is not the end. It the beginning.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN",
